			<Text>The kingdom of Denmark, having thrived throughout the 8-11th centuries AD during the height of the Viking age, would become embroiled in an ongoing war with Norway during the early 11th century. Harald Hardrada, King of Norway, who disputed Sweyn's right to the Danish throne after the passing of King Magnus I in 1047, would become the primary rival of the Danish King Sweyn II.  For years the two would engage in military skirmishes, until finally reconciling after nearly 15 years when it became clear neither would be the victor.</Text>

Not long after, invasions by the Norwegian King Harald Hardrada and more importantly William, Duke of Normandy, would change the political landscape of England forever. Successfully defeating Harald at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in September of 1066, Godwinson would have to quickly regroup and head south to face William only a few short weeks later. However, the Norman armies led by William would prove too much for Godwinson. They would crush Harold's forces at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, leaving Harold dead and England open for the taking.</Text>

After the death of Magnus I in 1047, Harald disputed the notion that Sweyn II was the legitimate ruler of Denmark and the two became notorious rivals. Despite several attempts, Harald was never successful in conquering Sweyn, and instead set his sights on the English throne. In September of 1066, Harald would invade England, only to be killed at the Battle of Stamford Bridge by the armies of Harold Godwinson.</Text>

			<Text>Your spies can steal technology from a more advanced civilization. To attempt to steal technology, first, move a spy to a target city within another civilization. Once the spy arrives, there will be a period of time where they are "Establishing Surveillance" (noted in the "Activity" column). Once surveillance is established, you will know whether the target has technology that you can steal. If they do, the time it takes to steal the technology depends on how much science the target city is producing, and the rank of your spy. The higher your rank, the more quickly you will be able to steal technology. The higher the science output, the faster your spy can work.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Other factors that can affect the time it takes to steal technology includes defensive buildings like the Police Station or the Great Firewall wonder, which can stop a spy completely. Additionally, if the target has placed a defensive spy in the same city, your spy can be caught, or even killed (he will be taken out of action for multiple turns). This, of course, will have a negative effect on your diplomatic relations with the target civilization.</Text>

			<Text>Unlike most capitals in southern Africa, Antananarivo was already a major settlement before the arrival of the Europeans. It served as the seat of the Hova chieftains, having been founded c. 1625 AD; it took its name, "City of the Thousand," from the number of soldiers reputed to guard it. Between 1689 and 1725, Madagascar was a pirate haven, and the capital city grew rich on booty and plunder paid for shelter and protection. By 1793, when it served as seat of the Merina kings who controlled all Madagascar, it was a city of about 80,000. It was the commercial center of the island; Antananarivo's thriving economy was fueled by the export of tobacco and leather goods, most bound for Europe and India.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Antananarivo was captured by French troops in 1895 AD and forcibly incorporated into their Madagascar protectorate. The new French administrators commenced an extensive rebuilding program. Under the relatively benign French rule, the city grew to 175,000 inhabitants by 1950. Along with two forts, schools and a university, parks, paved roads and paths, and a water system, the French also constructed churches - today there are some 5000 church buildings in the city and its suburbs. In 1955, it was made an archdiocese of the Catholic Church.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1947, with their prestige and military presence at low ebb due to World War II, the French suppressed a bloody revolt by Malagasy nationalists; between 80,000 and 90,000 died in the year-long fighting. The French subsequently instituted wide reforms under the Loi Cadre, which provided for a peaceful transition to independence for the country. Following the creation of the republic, Antananarivo was made the capital. Bolstered by lucrative industries producing food, cigarettes and textiles, the city modernized rapidly. With nearly two million citizens today, Antananarivo is one of Africa's wealthiest cities.</Text>

Built up over the years through the efforts of several ruling kingdoms, by the 16th century Antwerp had grown to become the wealthiest city in Europe, serving as an economic hub for traders from across the world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During Antwerp's height as a thriving financial center, the city was home to international traders, merchants, and bankers who flocked to the growing city, bringing with them art and culture from abroad. Although the city enjoyed a period of calm and prosperity, the tumult of the Protestant Reformation, along with the increasing influence of nearby Amsterdam, led to a swift decline in Antwerp's economy and population by the 18th century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the 20th century, Antwerp was occupied by Germany during World War II, only to be liberated by the Allied forces after several years of conflict. Unfortunately for the people of Antwerp, Germany battered the city with V-2 rockets in an attempt to disrupt the flow of supplies arriving in Antwerp's port.

			<Text>The many ancient kingdoms of Assyria, long since swept into the dust of history, were at various times among the most prosperous and powerful of any on Earth. Centered in the heart of Mesopotamia (modern northern Iraq), Assyria was founded by Semitic descendants of Akkadian and Sumerian refugees following the collapse of the Akkadian Empire c. 2154 BC, whose languages and customs slowly coalesced into two distinct Mesopotamian peoples: the Assyrians in the north and Babylonians in the south. Despite a number of initial attempts at forming an independent kingdom, the Assyrians were continually thwarted by the expansion of their neighbors, particularly Babylon. Eventually, commencing with the near-legendary Tudiya, Assyrian kings succeeded in establishing a great empire - and on more than one occasion Assyria was the most powerful state in the region. However, Assyria also continued to suffer at the hands of neighboring rivals, and by the late 6th Century BC, the empire was no more.</Text>

			<Text>Located in the fertile region of Mesopotamia around the Tigris-Euphrates river system, Assyria lay in a land capable of producing bountiful harvests of wheat and other grains. Widely considered to be the cradle of Western civilization, in the Bronze Age Mesopotamia was dominated by the Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian cultures. The climate of Assyria was semi-arid, although the kingdom received ample water in the form of snowmelt and rain from the Zagros Mountains throughout the year. The river region (some 5800 square miles) is marked by marshes, lagoons, mud flats and reed banks. Irrigated agriculture spread south from the Zagros foothills commencing around 5000 BC; Assyrian farmers are known to have planted such crops as wheat, barley, onions, grapes, turnips and apples. The land that once constituted the Assyrian homeland is now primarily encompassed by parts of Syria, Iran, Iraq and Turkey. Bordered to the north by rugged mountains, to the west by the Aramaeans, to the south by the kingdoms of Babylonia and Elam and the Amorite tribes of Arabia, the Assyrians were in a fruitful but tenuous position.</Text>

			<Text>The oldest Neolithic sites in Assyria date to c. 7100 BC, and the earliest evidence of human culture, the Hassuna culture, to c. 6000 BC. The region that would encompass Assyria is home to the first known examples of irrigated agriculture, and to some of the earliest human settlements. Among these can be included Assur, which was founded at some point in the mid-3rd millennium BC; it appears to have been an administrative center for Sumaria rather than an independent city. Nineveh, although likely established far earlier, is first mentioned in historical records in 1800 BC as the center of worship for Ishtar, the primary deity of Mesopotamia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the third and second millenniums BC, a cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and Semites gave rise to the Akkadian empire, of which the Assyrian cities were a vital element. The list of Assyrian kings, commencing with Tudiya, begins with the fall of the Akkadian empire, destroyed by internal strife, economic collapse and the incursions of barbarians. However, after a brief period of independence, the Assyrian lands were absorbed by the Third Sumerian Empire of Ur, which had been founded in 2112 BC. From the decline of the Akkadian and subsequently the Sumerian empires, a distinct Assyrian culture emerged to establish customs and traditions of their own, coinciding with crucial technological developments in agriculture, animal husbandry, pottery, and metal working.</Text>

			<Text>Although the ancient Assyrian "King List" records many early kings, dating back as far as the 19th Century BC, the earliest Assyrian king for whom any definitive historical context exists was King Shamshi-Adad I, who ruled the city of Assur and established Assyrian control over much of Mesopotamia. He had deposed the Akkadian ruler of Assyria in 1813 BC and proclaimed himself the new king. Shortly thereafter, Shamshi-Adad began a campaign of expansion. He placed one of his sons on the throne of the nearby city of Ekallatum, and reestablished authority over Assyria's small Anatolian colonies. He next conquered the kingdom of Mari along the Euphrates, placing another son on the throne there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shamshi-Adad retired to oversee construction of a new capital city for himself, but died c. 1790 BC before it was completed. His sons fared poorly thereafter. The younger was overthrown by a rebellion in Mari, whose new king promptly allied himself with the king Hammurabi, who was in the process of making the newly-created kingdom of Babylon a major military power. The Babylonian forces swept into Assyria, overwhelming several cities. With Hammurabi's support, the Anatolian cities revolted and broke away from the Assyrian kingdom. Finally, the Babylonian king conquered Ekallatum itself, and the first fledgling Assyrian Empire fell and was fully absorbed into Babylon by 1756 BC. However, the bloodline of Assyrian kings survived as vassals to Hammurabi.</Text>

			<Text>Hammurabi's short-lived empire rapidly unraveled following his death c. 1750 BC, and Babylon lost control over Assyria during the reign of his immediate successor. Commencing with the overthrow of an Amorite king ruling Assyria for Babylon by the vice-regent Puzur-Sin, the country plunged into a period of unrest and civil war, marked by relatively short reigns by the Assyrian kings. In the 16th Century BC, the Mittani - an Indo-European people - overran Anatolia and pushed eastwards, capturing and sacking Assur around 1480 BC. The Assyrian monarchy survived as vassals, and the Mittani appear to have been content to avoid interference in internal Assyrian affairs so long as tribute was paid.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By the reign of Eriba-Adad I (1390-1366 BC), Mittani power had declined significantly and his successor, Ashur-uballit, spent his years making Assyria an empire again. Having defeated the Hurrians and the Hittites to end any threat from that quarter, Ashur-uballit married his daughter to the last Kassite king of Babylon. When the Babylonian king was murdered by an unruly political faction, Ashur-uballit promptly invaded and absorbed Babylon. Shortly after he moved against the Mittani, crushing their forces despite military support for them from the Hittites and Hurrians. The lands of the Mittani and the Hurrians were appropriated, making Assyria a large and powerful kingdom once again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over the next two centuries, an unbroken succession of able kings insured the prosperity and stability of the kingdom, making it the dominant power in Mesopotamia. Internal reforms and policies maintained their popularity among the people and nobles, while a sequence of victories expanded Assyrian holdings into Asia Minor and the Levant. In 1274 BC, the great warrior king Shalmaneser I ascended the throne, pushing the boundaries of the Assyrian empire into the Caucasus Mountains and overrunning eastern Anatolia. At its peak, the empire stretched from the shores of the Persian Gulf to those of the Mediterranean. But following the death of emperor Tilgath-Pileser I, Assyria entered a 300-year period of decline.</Text>

			<Text>Mesopotamia entered a "Dark Ages" (dated c. 1200-900 BC) as less-civilized peoples overran much of the region. Semitic peoples such as the Arameans and Chaldeans nibbled at the western and southern borders of the Assyrian Empire, conquering much of Babylon. The Medes and Persians swept into the lands east of the Assyrian heartland. To the north, the Phrygians overran the Hittites and Armenian tribes pushed the Assyrians out of the Caucasus. Cimmerians and Scythians began migrations outward from their Black Sea homelands. Assyrian kings during this time seem to have contented themselves with defending a compact area centered on Assur and Nineveh and the trading center of Nimrud, surrendering the outer areas and colonies to the inevitable. They largely limited their military adventures to sporadic punitive raids against these barbarians, interspersed with the occasional effort at re-conquest of lost territories. Nonetheless these efforts slowly transformed Assyria into a warrior culture, even as trade collapsed and religion flourished. Anshur became the state god, and the priesthood rose to be a major political power in the kingdom, culminating in the murder of king Tukulti-ninurta I.</Text>

			<Text>The resurgence of Assyrian influence begins with the accession of Adad-nirani II in 911 BC. This "Neo-Assyrian" Empire would survive until the fall of Nineveh in 612 BC to an allied force of Babylonians, Medes, Scythians and Cimmerians. At its zenith, around 671 BC, the empire would reach from the Nile River across northern Arabia to the Persian Gulf, north to the Zargos and Caucasus mountain ranges, and deep into Asia Minor in the west. It would cover all or portions of the present-day nations of Iraq, Iran, Georgia, Turkey, Armenia, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Kuwait, Egypt and Saudi Arabia - the largest empire yet seen in human history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beginning with the campaigns of Adad-nirani, Assyria subjugated the border territories and vassals that had seen only nominal Assyrian authority for a century. King Adad-nirani I then proceeded to conquer troublesome Aramean, neo-Hittite and Hurrian populations to the north. It was at this point that he instituted the state policy of deporting and resettling new subject peoples to other parts of the Assyrian empire, a ruthless policy his successors would follow. In the last years of his reign, he launched a successful campaign against Babylonia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Upon Adad-Nirani's death in 892 BC, his heir would consolidate these gains as well as conquer the Persian and Medean settlements in the Zargos Mountains. Subsequent rulers would use the revitalized Assyrian military, notably its siege engines (which were particularly effective against mud-brick city walls), to great benefit as they overran vast tracts in the Arabian Peninsula, Asia Minor and Mesopotamia itself. Even the queens pursued Assyrian expansion. When Adad-nirani III (810-782 BC) came to the throne he was a small boy; his mother, semi-legendary queen Semiramis, serving as regent, crushed the last holdings of the Medes and Persians for the empire before abdicating power to her son after a few years.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following a brief period of peace, expansion continued apace under Adad-nirani's successors in an unbroken string of conquests. Tiglath-pileser III (who reigned 745-727 BC), Sargon II (722-705), and the ruthlessly-effective Sennacherib (705-681) would add Phoenicia, Israel, Judah, Samaria, Palestine, Cyprus, Moab and vast tracts in the Taurus Mountains and the Arabian Peninsula to the empire. Sennacherib's heir Esarhaddon crossed the Sinai Desert to invade Egypt, driving its Nubian rulers out and, in the process, destroying the Kushite Empire. Returning to Assyria, Esarhaddon began the rebuilding of the city of Babylon which had been leveled following a revolt but died while preparing another invasion of Egypt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Esarhaddon's death in 669 BC brought Ashurbanipal, considered to be the greatest of neo-Assyria's emperors, to the throne. Although more concerned with reform and scholarship, Ashurbanipal proved a capable warrior as well. Although he spent much of his time suppressing revolts and border incursions, he also completed the conquest of Egypt, the last expansion of the neo-Assyrian Empire. However, Ashurbanipal is best known for his efforts to rebuild cities, sponsor advances in Assyrian arts and sciences, and establish libraries throughout the realm. The cuneiform and scribal texts found by archeologists in his great palace library in Nineveh have provided much of what is known of not only Assyria but the entire region during this era.</Text>

			<Text>Following the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC, a number of short-lived rival successors claimed the throne; Assyria was thrust into a period of civil war. The disarray and devastation brought by these conflicts led directly to the decline and dissolution of not only the Assyrian Empire, but also to the culture distinctly identified as "Assyria." In 605 BC, an alliance of Babylonians and Medes would defeat an Assyrian-Egyptian force at Carchemish and Assyria would become a Babylonian province. Following the collapse of the Baylonian Empire, the traditional Assyrian homeland would be overrun by waves of invaders ranging from the Persians through the Arabs. Knowledge of its glories and works would virtually disappear until brought to light by modern archeologists and historians, beginning with the excavations of fabled Nineveh in 1845 AD.</Text>

			<Text>Austria's earliest history centers on the nomadic Celts and their conflicts with the expansionist Roman Empire. In the waning stages of the 1st millennium BC, the area that today constitutes Austria was inhabited by Celtic tribes north of the Danube River. These early Celts originated from the Hallstatt Culture, so named for the Austrian village of Hallstatt where the majority of their artifacts have been discovered. The arrival of the Romans around 200 BC marked the end of the Celtic dominance in the area, as the Romans quickly subdued the local populace and seized control of the region. It was during this period that the ancient Celtic settlement of Vindobona was captured and converted into a Roman military outpost. Initially an encampment for Roman troops, Vindobona grew to become an important center of trade along the Danube, eventually becoming the site of Austria's future capital, Vienna.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although the Romans held dominion over southern Austria for several hundred years, by the 3rd century AD, increasingly powerful Germanic tribes from the north were making headway into Roman-controlled territory. By the 5th century, this loss of territory was but one of many problems facing Rome, as the decline of the empire spiraled out of control, allowing settlers from Bavaria and the surrounding area to move about uncontested. The city of Vindobona was captured by the nomadic Avars in 630 AD, who were then conquered themselves by Charlemagne in the late 8th century.</Text>

			<Text>In 976, the March of Austria, known in German as the Ostmark or "Eastern March," was formed, outlining much of the territory that would make up the future empire of Austria. A March, or border territory, was used to designate frontier regions in medieval Europe. The March of Austria was outlined by Holy Roman Emperor Otto II and superseded all previous designations of the area, including the Avar March laid out by Charlemagne in the 8th century encompassing the same region. The region would later be referenced as the Ostarrichi by Otto's son, Otto III.</Text>

			<Text>The House of Babenberg, the first ruling dynasty of the March of Austria, was a family of nobles whose ascension to power came at the behest of Holy Roman Emperor Otto II. Leopold I was named Margrave of Austria in 976 as a reward for his loyalty to Otto during an uprising in Bavaria in the prior years. The title "Margrave" was bestowed upon counts who ruled over the medieval marches, primarily in a military role as these frontier territories were used to buffer the heart of the empire. The Babenberg counts ruled Austria for nearly 300 years before the rise of Austria's most influential dynasty, the aristocratic House of Habsburg.</Text>

			<Text>The Habsburg Dynasty, first established by German King Rudolph I of Habsburg in the 13th Century, grew to become one of the most powerful ruling houses in all of Europe. The last of the Babenbergs, Duke Frederick II, died in 1246, providing the Habsburgs with an opportunity to seize control of the region. Following his selection as Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph claimed the provinces of Austria and faced a struggle for succession with the Bohemian prince Ottokar II. The successful outcome for Rudolph allowed him to install his two sons, Rudolph II and Albert I, as joint rulers, the first of the Habsburg line in Austria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over the next 600 years, the Habsburgs would enjoy increasing influence and authority in Europe, notably gaining the crown of the Holy Roman Emperor in 1452 with the selection of Frederick III by Pope Nicholas V. Frederick's breakthrough in gaining the position of Holy Roman Emperor ushered in an even greater expansion of Habsburg rule, who controlled Austria and the Holy Roman Empire up to the early 19th Century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During their long reign, the Habsburgs were successful in claiming a number of territories surrounding their seat of power in Austria, most importantly Hungary. Frequently the focus of conflict between the Habsburg Empire and the Ottoman Turks occupying large swaths of the nation, Hungary eventually fell under complete control of Austria following the Ottomans decisive loss at the Battle of Vienna and the eventual settlement of the Great Turkish War in 1699.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The last of the Austrian Habsburg monarchs, Maria Theresa, ruled in the 18th century and was faced with a war over her right to succession soon after her father's death. As the first female to ever lead the Habsburg Monarchy, Maria was met with contempt by the European powers of France and rival Prussia, who disputed her claim to the throne and incited the War of Austrian Succession. After nine years of conflict the war was settled in 1748, with Maria Theresa affirmed as ruler of Austria, but at the cost of ceding the valuable province of Silesia to Prussia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maria Theresa's reign was marked with a steady increase in the stability of her nation, due in part to her careful consideration of the economic and social policies she instituted. Balancing Austria's budget through increased taxation and regulated expenditures allowed her to strengthen Austria's depleted military, while improvements in education and medicine bolstered the well-being of her people.</Text>

			<Text>The outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars, beginning in the late 18th century, led to the creation of several coalitions opposed to Napoleon's French Empire. Austria joined the First Coalition against Napoleon in 1793, and despite a multi-pronged invasion of France joined by a number of European powers, the French were successful in repelling the invaders. Despite the setback, Austria continued to oppose the French and joined the majority of the seven coalitions that rose to confront Napoleon. Unfortunately Austria's early efforts led only to defeat, and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II formed the Austrian Empire in 1804 in an attempt to consolidate his land holdings in the region, naming himself Emperor of Austria. Abdicating the throne of Holy Roman Emperor, Francis signed the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805, dissolving the Holy Roman Empire itself in order to delegitimize claims made by Napoleon to German lands through his formation of the Confederation of the Rhine. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1813, the forces allied against France dissolved his confederation, which was then recreated as the German Confederation shortly thereafter.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a union of European states bound by the German language, the German Confederation was formed with Austria and Prussia joining as its most powerful members. However, cooperation between the two historical rivals was short-lived. Prussia and its closest ally, Italy, invaded the disputed state of Holstein, provoking Austria into war in 1866. Austria, joined by the majority of the confederation members, faced off against the superior Prussian military. After a brief conflict, Prussia won a decisive victory over the Austrian alliance and dissolved the German Confederation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1848, revolution swept across Europe, during a time known as the "Spring of Nations," when working-class citizens throughout Europe rose up against the longstanding monarchs ruling over them. Austria was not immune to these revolutionary ideals, as word spread from France of the uprisings, the subjects of the Austrian Empire joined in the opposition. Although the revolution in Austria was ultimately unsuccessful, it contributed directly to the future formation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as nationalism in Hungary grew increasingly potent and dissatisfaction with Austrian rule peaked. In an agreement that came to be known as the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph negotiated the creation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, maintaining the rule of the Austrian Emperor but providing Hungary with an independent parliament and government structure.</Text>

Having bore the burden of the war with Napoleon in the prior century, Austria's economic and military infrastructure was greatly weakened by the immense conflict, and this union strengthened Austria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The events leading up to World War I, tracing its roots to the First and Second Balkan Wars, stemmed from Austria-Hungary's continual power struggle with Russia and Serbia over control of the Balkan region.

A Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip was responsible for the assassination, and despite attempts at a diplomatic resolution, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in 1914. At the onset of war, a tangled web of alliances and treaty-bound nations sprang into action. Austria-Hungary was joined by her closest ally, Germany, against a united force led by Russia, who came to the defense of Serbia. France joined the conflict as a past ally to Russia, while Great Britain joined after Germany's invasion of Belgium. Although the conflict began as a dispute between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, the closely tied system of military alliances brought all of the world's major powers into the fight. After years of disastrous losses, Austria-Hungary was left in disarray, and the Treaty of Versailles brought an end to World War I in 1919.</Text>

			<Text>The Babylonian Empire was, rather than a new idea, a reinvigoration of the old Sumerian Empire of the city of Ur, which had also occupied the Fertile Crescent in what is today Southern Iraq. Babylonia was formed from a collection of roughly a dozen city-states and was named for its capital city of Babylon. (Pre-empire, the city of Babylon itself was in existence since at least the 24th century BC.)</Text>

			<Text>Babylon was located in the Fertile Crescent, the incredibly fecund region around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, extending west to the Mediterranean and down through modern Israel. The Fertile Crescent not only benefits from the rich soil and irrigation provided by the two ancient rivers, but it also lies at the crossroads of three major landmasses: Africa, Asia, and Europe, meaning it has insects, plants and animals from all three sources. This gives the region a biodiversity unmatched anywhere in the world. This also means that its human inhabitants had a huge variety of plants and animals to experiment with when learning how to farm and herd animals, thus explaining why humans advanced so rapidly in this area.</Text>

			<Text>Originally a disorganized region, Babylon and Babylonia began to grow as a center for culture, trade, and religion under the rule of Hammurabi in 1728 BC. Hammurabi was the first known ruler of united Babylonia as well as its greatest lawgiver. Hammurabi's Code of Laws specifically listed the acts that were criminal as well as the punishment for each act. Citizens were no longer at the mercy of capricious judges or nobility who could on a whim decide what was and wasn't illegal. So comprehensive was the Babylonian Code that little about its laws or governmental system changed in the entirety of the empire's 1,200 years of existence.</Text>

			<Text>Much like the Sumerian Empire from which they were descended, Babylonia was a nation of fanatical record-keepers. Starting with Hammurabi and continuing down until the empire's dissolution at the hands of Cyrus and the great Persian emperors, every financial transaction, every court verdict, every contract, and just about anything that could be written down, was - on clay tablets. With laws pertaining to almost every aspect of daily living, a significant amount of data was recorded, and much of this has been uncovered and excavated during the modern era. Researchers have even found several optical devices, similar to magnifying glasses, which were used to allow record keepers to write in smaller cuneiform, in order to fit more information on each clay tablet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite numerous regime changes, education reached exceptional heights among the Babylonians. Technical achievements such as the creation of a base 60, "sexigesimal," system of mathematics, are still used to this day. Sixty seconds per minute, sixty minutes per hour: modern time, is in fact, Babylonian time.</Text>

			<Text>After the death of Hammurabi (1750 BC), the empire slowly declined in power and influence. Following a Hittite raid which weakened the city, in approximately 1600 BC it was conquered by the Kassites who had emerged from what are now the mountains of Iran. The Kassites controlled Babylonia for 500 years, renaming the city Karanduniash.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1234 the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I temporarily conquered the city but the Kassites eventually reasserted independence, just in time for the Elamites to sack the city in 1158. Then the Babylonians regained control of their city (possibly because the Elamites had stolen everything that any invader might want). By 1124 the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar I sacked the Elamite city of Susa in revenge for their earlier attack on Babylon. But by 1000 BC, Babylon was once again under pressure from a resurgent Assyria. Babylon remained more or less under Assyrian domination until 627 BC.</Text>

During his reign it enjoyed something of a renaissance. Nebuchadnezzar engaged in a variety of city revitalization projects, rebuilding ancient temples and buildings, constructing extensive fortifications, and so forth. He also created the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. He employed foreign workers for much of the hard labor, which as an additional benefit dramatically increased the city's population.

It remained under Persian control until 331 BC, when it was captured by Alexander the Great, and then to the Seleucid dynasty after Alexander's death. In the period since, Babylon has all but vanished, reduced to mysterious mounds and piles of rubble, waiting for archaeologists to uncover their secrets.

			<Text>Originally included on Antipater's list of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World, the Walls of Babylon encapsulated the city and protected it from harm, circling the city on all sides and even spanning the Euphrates River (which ran through the center of the city).  The outer walls ran 10 miles in length, measured 25 ft thick, and were said to tower 320 ft over the city. Smaller walls ringed the city behind this primary one, assuring an extra line of defense if the first ever fell.  Some 250 towers dotted the length of the walls, providing excellent look-out points and combat stations for the skilled Babylonian archers.  The walls were impenetrable by any technology available to sieges at the time, large metal gates were installed at the river's ends, (preventing any underwater intruders), and eight massive gates were constructed to contain any foot traffic (the most famous being the Ishtar Gate).  These walls effectively protected the city for almost one hundred years.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It wasn't until 539 BC that a way around the wall's defenses was devised; Cyrus the Great unleashed a plan which diverted the Euphrates further upstream, lowering the water level so that anyone could walk through it.  His army snuck under the river's metal gates under the cover of darkness and took the city from within. While capable of stopping any direct means of assault, the walls couldn't stop one man's determined ingenuity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Much of the ancient walls still stand, a testament to their strength.  In 1983, Saddam Hussein began a reconstruction project at the site of the ancient city, including restoration of the walls and a recreation of the Ishtar Gate.  The project has since been put on hold, but Iraq hopes to continue further restoration of the walls and once again make Babylon a place of wonder.</Text>

It was founded by the Spaniard Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada, who in 1536 AD led an expedition of 500 conquistadors into the Rio Grande de la Magdalena in search of El Dorado. In clashes with the indigenous Muiscas, they plundered the temples at Zaque Quemuenchatocha and Sogamoso, taking emeralds and gold. But by March 1537 only 70 men remained and Quesada decided to build a settlement to serve as a base, locating it on a plateau in the northern Andes near what would be known as the Bogota River. In 1553 the central plaza was constructed, and a cathedral and government buildings begun. The town became the capital of the crown colony of New Grenada, and remained a viceroyship until it achieved independence under Simon Bolivar in 1819. In the following years, it served as the capital city of "Gran Columbia" (until 1830), then the Republic of New Grenada (1863), then of the United States of Columbia through 1886, when the current Republic of Columbia came into existence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Throughout these changes, Bogota flowered as the educational and cultural center of the nation, whatever form it took. In 1823, the towns public library was expanded, modernized and became the National Library. A few years later, a National Museum was founded. The first "State School," precursor to the National University of Columbia, was established in 1867. Due to its relative isolation, the city became a mecca for authors and poets looking to create new trends distinct from South American Spanish literary traditions, and from the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s was home to such great writers as Jose Asuncion Silva and Rafael Pombo. Despite bouts of civil unrest and civil war, the city was also a favorite haven of artists; in 1886, the National School of Beaux Arts was founded.

Among former colonies, Brazil is unique in the Americas because, beyond gaining its independence through a relatively peaceful path, it did not fragment into separate countries as did British and Spanish possessions. Brazil was a Portuguese colony from the time of the arrival of Pedro Cabral, who claimed it for his sovereign in 1500 AD, until the royal family in exile from their occupied homeland elevated it to the status of kingdom in 1815. Full independence was achieved in 1822 when the Empire of Brazil was created with a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary government. With the overthrow of Pedro II, the second and last emperor, in 1889 AD it became a republic. Although the republic would suffer through dictatorships and military juntas over the next century, true democracy returned in the 1980s when the first elected civilian government assumed power after a negotiated transition.

Brazil contains most of the Amazon River basin, the world's largest river system as well as the world's largest virgin rainforest. Thus, the country has a wide range of tropical and subtropical landscapes, including wetlands, savannahs, jungle-covered plateaus, and low mountains. Along Brazil's 7500-mile coastline lie a number of archipelagos. The main upland area of Brazil occupies most of the southern half of the country, rising to a mass of low mountain ranges such as the Mantiqueira and Espinhaco, whose highest peaks reach about 4000 feet. Lying on the equator, most of the nation has a tropical climate, divided into five subtypes: equatorial, tropical, highland tropical, temperate and subtropical. Temperatures across Brazil average 77 degrees Fahrenheit. Vegetation ranges from rainforests in the north to tropical savannahs in the center to coniferous forests in the south. As might be expected with such varied terrain and climate, Brazil's biodiversity is one of the richest in the world, with jaguar, ocelot, tapir, anteater, sloth, armadillo, deer, piranha, caiman, parrot, monkey and thousands of other species sharing the land and waters.</Text>

			<Text>The origins of the native inhabitants (called indios by the Portuguese) of Brazil are unknown; the earliest human fossils date back 10,000 years to the highlands of Minas Gerais. When Portuguese explorers arrived on the coast, some 2000 native tribes existed; semi-nomadic, they subsisted on hunting, fishing, migrant agricultural, tribal warfare and cannibalism. The land was claimed by Pedro Cabral in April 1500 when the fleet he was leading around the Cape of Good Hope was borne so far westward that he made landfall in South America. The Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494 AD had divided the New World between Spain (west) and Portugal (east) along the longitude of 46 degrees. As the discovery fell well within the Portuguese zone, and spurred by reports of its riches, in 1532 the first Portuguese settlement was founded.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The discovery of brazilwood - a dense, orange-red hardwood highly prized in dye-making and in the making of musical instruments and furniture - incited the crown's interest; in 1534 AD King Dom Joao III encouraged private colonial ventures. In 1549 the king appointed a governor-general and Brazil officially became a Portuguese colony. In wars with the French, the Portuguese slowly expanded their holdings to the north and south, taking Rio de Janeiro in 1567 and Sao Luis in 1615. In 1680 AD they claimed the lands around the Rio de la Plata, which became their southernmost territory. In the meantime, British and Dutch strongholds in the Amazon were overrun; the native tribes were either assimilated, enslaved or exterminated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By the end of the 17th Century, Brazil was the largest and most important of Portugal's scattered colonies. Besides brazilwood, sugar, dyes and spices were major exports. The Portuguese began their import of slaves from Africa to meet the growing international demand for these commodities; eventually Portugal would become one of the major slave-trading nations and slaves in Brazil would number in the hundreds of thousands. Concurrently, prospectors had sought in vain for gold in the jungles and hills of Brazil until extensive deposits were discovered in Minas Gerais. The subsequent gold rush brought such vast sums that the colonial capital was transferred from Salvador south to Rio de Janeiro in 1763 AD in order to better administer the new wealth. The treaties of Madrid (1750), Pardo (1761) and Ildefonso (1777) recognized Brazil's borders, while colonial reforms insured that it remained a placid, prosperous and profitable colony for Portugal.</Text>

			<Text>In March 1808 AD, the Portuguese royal family and ministers arrived in Rio de Janeiro to take refuge in Brazil as Napoleon's forces overran their homeland. The prince regent Joao, ruling in the stead of his mother Maria I, who was incapacitated due to mental illness, re-established his capital in Rio and ruled the empire from there. While in residence, he put in place all the ministries of a sovereign capital, as well as founding a royal library, a military academy, a royal mint, a printing office, and medical and law schools. In 1815, Joao declared Brazil a kingdom, co-equal with Portugal in the empire. Following the defeat of France, he preferred to remain in Brazil until called back to Portugal to deal with radical revolts. In April 1821, Joao appointed his son Pedro to the regency. Pedro's ministers, many Brazilian born, urged independence; the young regent issued a declaration of independence for Brazil in September 1822 and was crowned as Emperor Pedro I within three months. In 1825 the Portuguese government officially recognized Brazil's sovereignty, and within the year most of the European nations followed suit.</Text>

			<Text>Pedro I and his ministers sought to insure that Brazil did not suffer the discord and revolutions that were plaguing Brazil's South American neighbors. To that end, he was the primary architect of a new constitution, one quite liberal and advanced for its time. But Pedro was increasingly involved in affairs in Portugal, and in 1831 AD abdicated in favor of his five-year-old son so he could return to Europe to reclaim the Portuguese crown for his daughter. To settle the political unrest and discord the abrupt departure left, Pedro's son was officially declared of age at 14 and crowned Emperor Pedro II within the year. The new emperor's five-decade reign was enlightened and progressive, and Brazil enjoyed a "golden age" in every realm - politically, economically, industrially, socially, culturally. Under Pedro II, Brazil won three wars, expanded its international reputation, modernized, reformed its legal and monetary systems, boosted its agricultural diversity, and abolished slavery. But the latter had eroded support among the landed gentry; moreover, as he aged Pedro II increasingly lost touch with the new urban middle class and liberal student movements his ideals and policies had fostered. Although still respected and beloved by his people, in November 1889 a bloodless military coup deposed Pedro in favor of a republic. Ever a patriot, when he departed into exile in Europe, Pedro II expressed his "ardent wishes for the greatness and prosperity of Brazil."</Text>

			<Text>Manuel de Fonseca, who had led the coup, became the provisional president of an increasingly military-dominated government. Supported primarily by the military and the increasingly prosperous coffee planters, he established the republic, separated church and state, and promulgated a new constitution. However, under its provisions, he was declared unable to hold office; when he attempted to dissolve the new legislature and rule by decree, he was forced to resign in the face of public outcry. He was replaced by his vice-president, also a general, who spent his time fending off several military and monarchist revolts but took on increasingly dictatorial powers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1894 AD, amid general peace, General Peixoto reluctantly surrendered the presidency to the first civilian to hold the post, Prudente de Morais. He had been governor of the coffee-rich state of Sao Paulo, and has been deemed the first of the "coffee presidents." These presidents, primarily wealthy politicians and landowners from Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, helped reform the economy, modernize the nation's infrastructure, keep the peace, and guide the nation through troubled international times through a policy of near isolationism. However, in doing so they offered little real democracy because only the landowning minority was allowed to vote, fraudulent elections were common, and regional political bosses operated with virtual impunity so long as they supported the president in power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Two developments finally ended the period of the "coffee presidents." First, coffee prices fell precipitously during the world-wide depression of the 1930s. Second, a movement composed of junior officers (the tenentes) grew in influence. Espousing populism, the tenentes championed not democracy but reform and progress; they fervently believed that only the military could propel the nation into the modern age. To do so, the young officers planned to oust civilian politicians, expand the reach of the federal government, modernize the military, and eradicate regionalism through a strong, centralized government.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The depression and the general unrest led to Getulio Vargas, a defeated presidential candidate, to seize control with support of the tenentes. Vargas was supposed to assume power temporarily for the duration of the economic crisis; instead he closed the Congress, dismissed the constitution, and replaced the Brazilian states' governors with his supporters, mostly military officers. Following a failed Communist coup in 1935 and a failed Fascist one in 1938, Vargas' regime evolved into a full dictatorship, noted for its brutality and censorship of the press. Brazil joined the Allies in 1942 as an active participant, committing both significant ground in Italy and naval forces in the Atlantic. Despite being a dictatorship, Vargas insisted that in recognition of its service in World War II, Brazil be one of the founding members of the United Nations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But the economic boom brought by the war and international pressure had made Vargas' position untenable; in 1945 AD he was ousted by another military coup. Democracy was "reinstated" by the same cabal that had suspended it 15 years before. Ironically, Vargas would be elected president in 1950, but committed suicide in 1954 at the Catete Palace in the midst of a political crisis. Several brief governments followed Vargas' death, marked by various levels of accomplishment as well as corruption. In 1964, yet another military coup toppled the civilian government; in 1968, the military junta became a full dictatorship with the powers vested in it by the Fifth Institutional Act. Although its methods were harsh, the junta was less brutal than those in other parts of the continent. Moreover, it promoted capitalism, modernization, and international accords. Thus, the junta was highly popular with the lower and middle classes even during the years of repression.</Text>

Over several years he ended the torture of political prisoners, censorship of the press, and finally the junta itself when he repealed the Fifth Institutional Act. His successor continued the process, and in 1985 the first free elections made Jose Sarney president. With a stable government and thriving economy, Brazil has since taken a leading role in regional affairs, being a founding member of organizations such as the Latin Union, Organization of American States, Mercosul, and Union of South American Nations. At the beginning of a new millennium, Brazil is poised to assume an equally influential role on the world stage.</Text>

			<Text>An energetic and seductive city, which stretches north to south along the Rio de la Plata covering 78.5 square miles, Buenos Aires has been the gateway to Argentina for centuries. Portenos, as the multinational citizens of Buenos Aires term themselves, possess an elaborate and rich cultural identity, drawing on Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Irish, Polish, Jewish as well as native influences; the city has often been referred to as the "Paris of South America." Its lifestyle and architecture is more distinctly European than those of any other city in the southern hemisphere. Its physical layout is a mosaic as varied as its people, its cuisine, and its music. Buenos Aires is, not surprisingly, the most visited city in South America (ahead of even Rio de Janeiro).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The city was founded as Ciudad de Nuestra Senora Santa Maria del Buen Ayre ("City of Our Lady Saint Mary of the Fair Winds") in 1536 AD by a Spanish expedition. When Argentina became independent in 1816, the cosmopolitan city became its capital. In the decades between 1880 and 1940, Buenos Aires became a haven for those seeking refuge from political, religious, ideological and artistic persecution in countries across Europe. From hungry Irish to devout Jews to Tsarist survivors, each wave of immigrants brought their traditions and talents to add to the stew, making the city the cultural rival of any world capital.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps nothing reflects the city's unique cultural blend as does the tango. A combination of several dances, the tango evolved in Buenos Aires in the late 1880s. Practiced in dance halls, parks, open plazas and ballrooms, it became the national dance, combining both "elegant reserve and an exuberant passion." Few dances have been so identified with a place as the tango is with Buenos Aires, the soul of Argentina.</Text>

Usually associated with a mosque, madrasahs could even specialize in medicine, law, science, philosophy or the education of women. The first madrasah, the Gama'at al-Qarawiyyn, was established in 859 AD by Fatimah al-Fihri, the daughter of a wealthy merchant. During the rule of the Fatimid, Ayyubid and Mamluk dynasties, the practice of sponsoring madrasahs by the ruling, wealthy elite spread across Egypt and the Middle East. The first Ottoman madrasah was founded in 1331 AD in Iznik, and followed the traditions of Sunni Islam. The madrasahs of the Turks and Arabs would, as Europe suffered through the Dark Ages, keep the best of Western knowledge alive, and blend it with that of the East.</Text>

In roughly 285 AD, the system Diocletian devised, Tetrarchy, divided leadership of the Roman Empire among four rulers, with four frontier capitals.

			<Text>The early development of a distinct Byzantine Empire can be attributed directly to the efforts of the Roman Emperor Constantine I, who, in 330 AD chose the city of Byzantium as the settlement which would become the "Second Rome"- Constantinople. Intended to serve as the capital city of the Eastern Roman Empire (the "Byzantine Empire" being a name conceived of by modern historians), following the dissolution of Diocletian's tetrarchy, Constantinople's separation from Rome would prove to be more pivotal than expected.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With wealth came stability, and the Byzantine Empire, benefitting from its dominance of crucial trade routes, managed to avoid many of the conflicts that Rome itself could not. Relatively young as a city and geographically distant, Constantinople was far less of a prize to the raiders battering Rome during this period. However, the Byzantines were unable to escape the keen eye of history's greatest barbarian - Attila the Hun. These ongoing conflicts with the Huns proved to be troublesome for the Byzantines. Had Attila not died in 453, things might have turned out differently for the empire, as it is said that Attila was planning to return and conquer the kingdom once and for all, following his campaign in Italy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this period, the Western Roman Empire (Rome proper) had endured continual economic and military strife, and following the eventual fall of Rome itself to the increasingly powerful Germanic tribes, the Byzantine Empire would rise to succeed Rome, becoming one of the most influential kingdoms on the world's stage.</Text>

The Byzantine general Belisarius, who would also serve Justinian in crushing the infamous Nika revolt, led a number of successful campaigns against the Vandals and Ostrogoths during this period of reclamation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was during the Justinian Dynasty that Empress Theodora came to play an influential role in the empire. Wife and co-ruler to Justinian I, Theodora made her mark on history as a highly intelligent, trusted advisor to Justinian and an early advocate for the rights of women within the empire. It was Theodora's emphatic speech that guided Justinian through the Nika revolt, an uprising of rival political factions attempting to usurp Justinian's throne in 532.  It is said that while Justinian considered fleeing the city, Theodora implored him to remain, allegedly quoting an ancient saying "Royalty is a fine burial shroud." Justinian heeded Theodora's advice, ordering his general Belisarius to suppress the rebellion, leading to an eventual massacre at the Hippodrome that would secure Justinian's throne.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was also during the Nika revolts that the predecessor of the Hagia Sophia, a Christian church dating to the early times of Constantinople, was destroyed. The grand monument as it is today was constructed shortly after Justinian and Theodora quashed the revolt.

Artisans and craftsmen labored to produce grand works of art throughout the city, displaying the influences of their Greek and Roman heritage, as well as the overwhelming authority of the Christian doctrines within the city. Christian art and icons would be revered within the empire for centuries, until the rise of iconoclasm, a backlash against the adulation of religious icons, in the 8th century AD. Although the spark that ignited such fierce iconoclasm within the empire is still debated today, it can be said with certainty that this response led to the destruction of many great works of religious art within Constantinople.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Byzantine architecture is another widely recognized aspect of the empire's storied history. As with Byzantine art, architecture within the empire was heavily influenced by religious motifs.  The Byzantines' study of mathematics, which influenced both their aesthetic design as well as their engineering capabilities, allowed for the construction of elaborate basilicas throughout Constantinople.  Most notably, the Hagia Sophia and the massive underground water storage chamber known as the Basilica Cistern were completed during the reign of Justinian I.</Text>

			<Text>During the 7-9th centuries AD, the Byzantine Empire was ruled by a number of short-lived dynasties. In the 7th century, Constantinople fell under the rule of the Heraclians, who struggled continuously with conflicts against the Arab Umayyad forces. The Arabs went so far as to lay siege to the city itself in 674, and although the defenses of Constantinople held, the city entered a period of decline with sharp reductions in its population. This would mark the beginning of the Arab-Byzantine Wars, during which time the Christian Byzantine Empire would be entangled in near constant war with the Islamic Caliphs controlling portions of Iraq, Syria and southern Italy. This conflict would continue sporadically for the next 400 some years, and the empire would suffer through some of its lowest points, before the resurrection of Byzantine power by the Macedonians in 867.</Text>

			<Text>During the reign of the Macedonian Dynasty (867-1057), the Byzantine Empire grew to perhaps its greatest heights, recovering from centuries of decline and once again entering a period of affluence and cultural expansion.  Beginning with the reign of Basil I, a growth in both economic prosperity and military power bolstered the empire, and the Byzantines managed a number of key victories over the Arabs and the Bulgarians, regaining lost territory in parts of Syria and the Balkans.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It would be these clashes with the Bulgarians in particular that would have the greatest effect on the future Byzantine Empire. As a result of the Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars, by 1018, the Byzantines had conquered Bulgaria and subjugated the Bulgars. The Bulgars would eventually become unlikely bedfellows to the Byzantines following the siege of the Fourth Crusade.</Text>

			<Text>Although the crusades are often seen as a direct response to the increasing power of the Islamic Arab states and the need to assist the Byzantines in thwarting them (as the primary Christian stronghold in the east), the crusaders didn't always target Constantinople's enemies. The Fourth Crusade was said to have been focused on taking control of Muslim-held Jerusalem, but instead the attackers moved to Constantinople, apparently still clinging to the events of the Great Schism of 1054, which isolated the Eastern Orthodox Church (Byzantines) from the Roman Catholic Church. In 1204, Constantinople was conquered by the crusaders, led by the Franks and the Venetians, and the city was relentlessly pillaged. The crusaders destroyed many of the Orthodox Churches and their relics, defiling them in ways said to have disturbed even the Pope, who had initiated the crusade in the first place. The events of the Fourth Crusade, creating both physical and political havoc within the Byzantine Empire, are said to have directly contributed to its downfall at the hands of the Ottoman Turks less than three centuries later.</Text>

After making a number of unreasonable demands, perhaps knowing that Carthage would refuse, the Romans besieged the city for three years. Enduring until 146 BC, the beleaguered people of Carthage were eventually forced to surrender, Carthage itself was burned to the ground and much of the remaining population was slaughtered, the survivors sold into slavery.

Retold over the centuries in both historical record and folklore, the story of Carthage's founding is intertwined with the legend of Dido, first queen of Carthage. Dido's cunning escape from Tyre and eventual settlement in North Africa serves as the liveliest account of the city's creation, although traditional historians accredit Phoenician colonists with the task.  There is little debate, however, that the city was first settled sometime around 814 BC, taking its name from the Phoenician "Qart-hadast," meaning "The New Town." In Dido's tale, she is said to have acquired the land from a local king, after he agreed to sell her as much land as she could cover with an ox hide.

			<Text>The increasing tension with Greece over control of Sicily led to a series of conflicts that came to be known as the Sicilian Wars. During the 7th century BC, Greece continued to expand its colonies in southern Italy and to the west in Sicily, as trade prospered, despite the growing rivalry with Carthage. Eventually, Carthage was forced to deal with the Greeks' continued encroachment into the territory that was once firmly Phoenician, not only to ensure a steady flow of income, but also to forcefully assert that Carthage would protect the remaining Phoenician colonies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although records of their skirmishes are limited, the Carthaginians primarily fought the Greeks on the island of Sicily itself. Initially Carthage simply aided the colonies in their individual efforts to resist Greek incursions, until open warfare erupted in 480 BC, when the Battle of Himera was fought on Sicily between the forces of Carthage under Hamilcar Mago and the armies of Greece led by Gelo, ruler of Syracuse. Although the details are unclear, Carthage was unceremoniously crushed by the Greek forces, allegedly suffering casualties in the hundreds of thousands. Hamilcar himself was killed, and, after just one great battle, Carthage was forced to withdraw, paying reparations to the Greeks in order to maintain control of their colonies in Sicily.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 410 BC, Carthage once again set out to defeat Greece and wrestle control of Sicily, this time under the leadership of Hannibal Mago, grandson of the previously defeated Hamilcar Mago. Hannibal Mago met with greater success than his grandfather, conquering several Greek controlled cities before eventually returning to Carthage. In 405 BC, Mago finally attempted to sweep across all of Sicily, but he and his army were sickened by the plague, and Mago himself died shortly thereafter.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] War with Greece continued throughout the 4th century BC, eventually culminating with the complete control of Sicily by Carthage.

			<Text>During the ongoing conflicts between the Greeks and Carthaginians, Rome moved to assert its dominance over the whole of Italy. By the 3rd century BC, Rome became embroiled in a conflict with the Greek state of Epirus, who came to the defense of Tarentum, an Italian colony involved in an increasingly tense diplomatic dispute with Rome.  After several Roman ships were sunk in the harbor of Tarentum, Rome declared war on the colony, which drew Epirus into the fight. The Greek ruler, Pyrrhus of Epirus, won several early battles against the Romans, including the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC. Rome sought reinforcements from Carthage, who agreed to create an alliance against the Greeks. Later at the Battle of Asculum in 279 BC, Pyrrhus was again successful in defeating the Roman army, but at a steep cost. Losing several thousand men in the conflict, this battle is the origin of the phrase a "Pyrrhic Victory," which came to mean a victory that comes at too great of an expense. Within five years time, Pyrrhus was forced to fully withdraw, and Rome's control of Italy was unquestioned. Carthage now stood alone as the biggest threat to Roman dominance of the Mediterranean.</Text>

A series of escalating clashes that came to be known as the Punic Wars erupted in 264 BC, when both powers became entangled in a local squabble over control of the Sicilian city of Messina. While the Romans excelled in land-based warfare, Carthage controlled the most intimidating navy of the time, and the Romans were forced to adapt to succeed against the Carthaginian fleet. By utilizing boarding platforms mounted on their ships, the Romans found a way to reassert their infantry skills while at sea. The First Punic War was concluded by 241 BC, with Carthage having suffered a number of serious defeats, allowing Rome's authority to climb unabated. Carthage was forced to pay Rome a hefty price for peace, leaving the country on unstable footing both economically and militarily.</Text>

In 240 BC, the unpaid mercenaries of Carthage who fought in the First Punic War took to arms and incited an uprising that quickly spread throughout the Carthaginian territories. During the ensuing conflict, Hamilcar Barca, father of legendary general Hannibal, valiantly led a limited Carthaginian force to victory over the rebels thanks in no small part to Barca's tactical genius.

			<Text>The Second Punic War began in 218 BC, again over a regional dispute, this time in the Greek city of Saguntum on the Iberian Peninsula (Spain). By this time, legendary general Hannibal had risen to the position of Commander of the Carthaginian military. After continuing quarrels over control of the city, Hannibal led his army to Iberia and besieged Saguntum. Hannibal succeeded in capturing Saguntum and established a base of operations there, which immediately led to a declaration of war by Rome.  In a surprising tactical maneuver, Hannibal made the decision to lead his army on an overland march to Italy, a monumental undertaking that stands as the hallmark of his campaign against Rome. In leading his army through the treacherous route, Hannibal hoped to invade Italy and catch the unsuspecting Romans off guard. As his force of more than 100,000 infantry and cavalry endured the grueling trek through the Pyrenees and then the Alps, many men were lost, and a number of prized war elephants fell to the bitter cold of the mountains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The forces of Rome and Carthage eventually met at the Battle of the Trebia in northern Italy late in 218 BC. Despite the loss of troops during his march to Italy, Hannibal successfully bolstered his force by recruiting tribes from Gaul, who were keen to fight their Roman antagonists. Although accounts differ as to the details of the battle, it can be said with certainty that Rome was thoroughly defeated, losing thousands of men despite having fielded a greater army than Carthage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the war raged on, Hannibal was met with continued success, winning a number of early skirmishes before the Battle of Cannae, perhaps his greatest victory of the war. Fought near the village of Cannae on the southeastern coast of Italy, the battle was one of the largest of the war, as Rome attempted to counter Hannibal's push by fielding a massive number of legions. Unfortunately for Rome, throwing men into battle without proper direction provided no advantage, and Hannibal's tactics quickly overwhelmed the Romans. In a decisive blow, the Carthaginians ravaged the Roman columns, leading to casualties in the tens of thousands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following their demoralizing defeat at Cannae, the Romans began a campaign of attrition against Hannibal's forces, creating an eventual stalemate in Italy with neither side gaining additional ground. Although Hannibal was successful in capturing a number of colonies throughout Italy, the Romans had also made inroads in Iberia, conquering several crucial Carthaginian settlements there. The Romans' victories in Iberia revived their war effort, and under the leadership of Scipio Africanus, plans were laid for an invasion of Africa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hannibal returned to Carthage in 203 BC to face the impending threat from Scipio. Meeting at the Battle of Zama, Hannibal's depleted forces were outmatched by the freshly reinforced Roman army. Although Hannibal managed to escape from the battlefield with his life, much of his army was destroyed, and this defeat so close to home brought a quick end to the Second Punic War after more than a decade of near-constant strife.</Text>

These early Celtic people migrated over vast expanses, mixing their languages and religion with those of the existing inhabitants they encountered. In roughly 1300 BC, the first of these proto-Celtic groups, the Urnfield culture, was found primarily in the southernmost regions of present-day Germany. Living during the later stages of the Bronze Age, the people of the Urnfield culture expanded under the rule of primitive chiefdoms, eventually reaching as far as France. As the Urnfield population flourished and their territory expanded, the loosely affiliated tribes often struggled with one another, and it was not uncommon for the tribes to overrun their own outlying clansmen in a continuing cycle of expansion and integration.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The later development of the Hallstatt culture, so named for archaeological finds near the village of Hallstatt, Austria, continued the diffusion of proto-Celtic peoples throughout Europe.

Following their subjugation by the Romans, many of these elements adapted by the Celts were reconstituted by the Romans. Often featuring highly stylized renditions of animals, deities, and nature, Celtic art was frequently found emblazoned on Roman pottery and carvings. The Celts were also responsible for innovations in the art of warfare, developing unique sword and armor designs which are said to have influenced the development of the Roman Gladius and Spatha swords.</Text>

			<Text>Although we have little in the way of historical records about the ancient religion of the Celts, the priests of the era, known as Druids, have long been the subject of debate and interest among historians and the general public alike. Described by both the Greeks and Romans in the waning years of the 1st century BC, Druidism is thought to have been suppressed and eventually forgotten after the Roman conquest of Europe. Despite their own history of brutal conquests and the ease with which the Romans would take a life for entertainment purposes, they ironically considered the Celtic religion barbaric for the human sacrifices purportedly committed by the Druids. Whether or not the Druids actually used human sacrifice as extensively as the Roman accounts implied is still the subject of debate today.</Text>

			<Text>The Picts were a Late Iron Age people residing in what is now eastern and northern Scotland, one of the many Celtic tribes of the British Isles. Their warriors were feared not only amongst other Celtic peoples but even by the vaunted Roman legionnaires. The Greek historian Dionysius would write during the reign of Caesar Augustus that their "manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied," brought considerable success against unwieldy military formations operating in the forests and hills of northern Europe.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Adding to their frightful reputation was the use of the carnyx, a bronze trumpet sounded incessantly during battle, both to incite the Picts and intimidate opponents. Finally, firmly in the minds of their opponents were the reports of the severed heads Pictish warriors would carry.

			<Text>During the last Ice Age, the area that today constitutes Denmark was almost entirely covered by glacial formations. When the ice finally started to recede sometime around 12,000-14,000 BC, small groups of hunter-gatherers began to inhabit the area, surviving primarily by hunting reindeer. These hunters lived a nomadic lifestyle, moving with the seasons and following the migratory patterns of the animals they relied on for survival.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over time, the population of the small island region would continue to grow as immigrants moved north, bringing with them an increased knowledge of agriculture.  As early as 3,000 BC, farmers began to clear portions of the large deciduous forests found throughout Denmark, as evidenced by the many flint-stone axes unearthed in modern times throughout the country.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The custom of building "Dolmens," a form of tomb, and eventually "Passage Graves," also became prevalent around this time. The dolmen was a burial tomb consisting of several upright stones covered across the top with another large stone. These early burial tombs evolved into the Passage Grave, a megalithic structure consisting of a narrow entry lined with large stones, leading to a burial chamber covered in earth or additional stones. It's speculated that these megalithic tombs took entire communities years to construct, but having discovered examples that contained no human remains, archaeologists are still unsure of their true purpose.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the Nordic Bronze Age, these tombs further evolved into the "Tumulus," or burial mounds, commonly associated with the Vikings today. It was also during this period that the battle axe, legendary weapon of the Vikings, progressed from its Stone Age roots into early bronze renditions. Although Denmark had little in the way of copper resources to allow the creation of bronze, large quantities still made their way north via trade and conquest, allowing the Danes to master the art of metalsmithing. By the 8th century AD, iron was readily available, and the Vikings were well-equipped with their historic weapon of choice.</Text>

			<Text>Beginning in the late 8th century, each spring the Vikings of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden would conduct raids across the North Sea into England, eventually striking into France, Spain, and points east. In 793, the infamous Viking raid on Lindisfarne, a Christian monastery just off the English coast, would serve as an eye-opener to Western Europe and historically marks the unofficial dawn of the Viking Age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok, who sailed the river Seine in 845 and threatened the destruction of Paris, only to be paid a ransom of 7,000 lbs of silver instead, would solidify the Vikings place in history as the unrelenting scourge of Europe through the 11th century. Ragnar's alleged propensity for sacrificing captured prisoners to the Norse gods would terrify the Christian sensibilities of the European royalty, leading to increasingly larger payouts (known as "Danegeld") to appease the Vikings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The key to the Vikings success during their infamous raids was the Scandinavians' prowess in ship building. Already known for their fearless mastery of the seas, the construction of the "Langskip," or Viking Longship, gave the Vikings a previously unheard of advantage during this period. While relying on conventional sails when moving on the open seas, the Vikings could quickly revert to using oars for added maneuverability when moving near the coastline or on rivers. This versatility would prove to be the undoing of many European coastal settlements.</Text>

			<Text>King Gorm the Old would lay the groundwork for the Kingdom of Denmark beginning in c. 936 AD, ruling until his death in 958. However, it was his son, Harald Bluetooth, who would be the first to unite all of Denmark under one rule, expanding the kingdom's grasp into parts of Norway and Sweden. Bluetooth would become a strong proponent for the conversion of the Danish people to Christianity, a process that would continue under future kings, particularly Canute the Great and Sweyn II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Canute (also known as Cnut), ruled from 1016 until his death in 1035, and at one point would serve as King of England, Denmark, Norway and even parts of Sweden. His reign over England would prove to be pivotal, during which time monks from England were sent to Denmark to help further establish Christianity. As reparations to the Church, Canute ordered all of the English churches and monasteries destroyed or damaged by the Vikings in the past be repaired, going so far as to repay the wealth plundered from them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following the death of Canute, Magnus I would briefly rule both Norway and Denmark. However, it was the leadership of his successor, Sweyn II, that would make a more lasting impact on the kingdom. During Sweyn's reign, churches were constructed throughout Denmark, and he strove to unite his people with Christians throughout Europe by advancing the Danish people's knowledge of Latin.  Sweyn was not without controversy however, and his relationship with the Church was often strained. During his lifetime, he fathered over 20 children, 19 of whom have been confirmed to be illegitimate (born out of wedlock). Of those 19, five (Harald III, Canute IV, Olaf I, Eric I, and Niels) would peacefully succeed one another as future kings of Denmark over the 60 years following Sweyn's death in 1074.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Starting in 1397 and lasting up until 1523, Denmark was part of what came to be known as the Kalmar Union, through which the Kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden were united under a single leader. It was during this union that Denmark's first female monarch, Queen Margaret I, would serve until 1412. The current Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II, is the only other female ruler since.</Text>

			<Text>Throughout the 16-18th centuries, Denmark was a prosperous nation, benefiting from increased trade with Europe during this period.  Christian IV, Denmark's longest serving monarch, having ruled from 1588 until 1648, instituted a number of policies that would both expand Denmark's national defenses as well as bolster its economic and cultural foundations. During his reign, Christian more than doubled the size of the Danish navy, while also commissioning the construction of numerous fortresses. In 1616, the founding of the Danish East India Company would lead to a brief windfall for the nation, thanks to a trade monopoly awarded by Christian and various tea smuggling operations into England. Although he remains a popular historical leader in Denmark, his involvement in multiple wars, particularly the Thirty Years' War, would actually lead to a decline in Danish power throughout the Baltic region.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the Napoleonic Wars, Britain's displeasure with continued Danish trade with the French would lead to increasingly aggressive skirmishes at sea. In 1801, much of the Danish navy was destroyed by a British fleet outside of Copenhagen. Britain would grow increasingly concerned that Denmark's fall to the French was inevitable, leaving Britain with restricted access to the Baltic Sea, an unthinkable loss to the British military command.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1807, the Bombardment of Copenhagen (The Second Battle of Copenhagen) began when a massive British fleet, accompanied by ground forces encircling the city, attacked a greatly outnumbered Danish force that refused to surrender. Copenhagen was badly damaged, and over 5,000 civilians and soldiers were killed in the ensuing attack. The British confiscated any remaining ships of the Danish fleet, and drew Denmark into the war on the side of the French.  Denmark would fight until 1813, when the war effort plunged the nation into bankruptcy, forcing the signing of the Treaty of Kiel between Great Britain, Sweden, and the allied Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway.</Text>

Founded in roughly the 4th century BC, Axum grew to become a powerful center of trade over the next five hundred years. The valuable commodities of frankincense and myrrh, harvested from trees prevalent in Ethiopia, brought great wealth to the city of Axum and its people. Through the exportation of these goods, plus lucrative trades in ivory and various precious metals, Axum became an integral part of the trade routes connecting Egypt, Rome, and India, enough so to facilitate the minting of currency within Axum to support the flourishing local economy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, after centuries of prosperity, legends say the expansive empire's downfall came at the hands of a rebellious queen named Gudit. As the story goes, Axum had long been a stronghold of Christianity, and the Jewish queen Gudit sought the throne by way of conquest, purportedly devastating the countryside before murdering the royal family of Axum.

As battles raged for nearly 15 years, Ahmad was nearly successful in wiping out the entire kingdom, laying claim to vast swaths of Ethiopian territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After suffering such great losses, the Ethiopian Empire was forced to call on the assistance of Portuguese reinforcements to help in repelling the Islamic armies. Explorers and missionaries from Portugal had reached Ethiopia in the prior decades, intent on converting the populace to Roman Catholicism, and were fighting a war of their own against the Islamic Ottomans.  After a prolonged conflict that eventually drew the Ottomans in to aid the Adals, the war was settled in 1543 following the deaths of both Imam Ahmad and the Portuguese general Cristovao da Gama. Ethiopia was left to recover from the war, but the rapid spread of Catholicism in the surrounding regions led to internal strife as the Ethiopian Orthodox Church struggled to maintain a firm grip on the nation.</Text>

			<Text>The period known as the Zamana Mesafent, or "Age of Princes" in the 18th century was marked by near constant turmoil within Ethiopia. The development of opposing religious factions, along with constant regional disputes, led to the collapse of central government control. As battles erupted between the princes, warlords, and nobility, each attempting to divide the region and increase their own power, the common people of Ethiopia were forced to endure the ravages of these futile conflicts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Emperor who finally brought an end to the Age of Princes, Kassa Hailu, first gained notoriety as an outlaw and highwayman. Assembling an army and amassing great wealth through his smuggling operations, Kassa Hailu gained popular support by sharing his riches with the poor. After uniting several of the decentralized provinces and gaining a strong following, Hailu was eventually crowned as Emperor Twedoros II in 1855. Following his coronation, Ethiopia as a whole stabilized, and his reign is considered by many to mark the beginnings of modern Ethiopia.</Text>

			<Text>The Gatling gun, forerunner to the machine gun, was invented in 1861 AD by the American Dr. Richard Gatling in the hope of reducing the size of armies and displaying how futile war is. Operation of a Gatling gun involved a revolving multi-barrel design, in which a hand crank turned the mechanism. As each barrel cycled, the spent cartridge was ejected, a new one loaded, and the muzzle barrel cooled. In this manner, a high rate of fire could be maintained without overheating. What the Gatling gun lacked in accuracy was made up for by its lethality.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although not officially adopted by the United States Army until 1866, it was used for the first time in combat during the American Civil War by Union forces. It next saw use during the Peru-Chile War of the Pacific (1879-1883), which convinced European armies of its utility against massed enemies. Within a decade, the Gatling gun was adopted by most of the major powers; it was used most effectively to expand their colonial empires against the likes of the Ndebele, Zulu, Bedouins, Turkmen, Boxers, and other native peoples. In the first decade of the 1900s, designs for gas-operated "machine" guns made the weapon obsolete; the U.S. Army withdrew all models of the Gatling gun from service in 1911, followed soon after by the European armies.</Text>

The family lived destitute until he married his betrothed at the age of 16.</Text>

			<Text>Temujin began his bid for power by offering himself as a vassal to his late father's blood brother, Toghrul, the Khan of the Kerait tribe.  During this time, Temujin's wife was captured by the Merkit tribe, and Toghrul lent the young warlord 20,000 men to face them in battle.  Not only did Temujin recapture his wife, but he also completely defeated the Merkits, bringing them under this control.  He became a Khan in his own right and began conquering more of the neighboring tribes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During his conquests the young Khan fundamentally broke with Mongol tradition - he created a new set of laws and incorporated his captured holdings into his growing empire, rather than destroying and pillaging them.  His law, the Yassa, promised soldiers fair pay and wealth, outlawed thievery and pillaging of any kind, and promised protection and religious freedom for all conquered tribes.  Temujin's political innovations brought him much loyalty and strongly united his growing nation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The rest of his outward expansion and unification of the Mongol tribes is filled with tales of betrayal, intrigue, dashing victories, conspiracies, familial disputes, and more betrayal, including rifts between his former ally Toghrul and eldest son Jochi.  However, despite these setbacks he managed to subdue or unite all the nomadic tribes in the Mongolia area by 1206, the first man to ever do so.  At a joint council of chiefs he was given the name Genghis Khan?, the eternal and universal ruler of the Mongol peoples.</Text>

In 1209, he forced the surrender of the Xia provinces, and shortly thereafter in 1211, he finished the conquest of the Jin Dynasty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Next he turned his attention west toward Persia.  In a deft maneuver containing only two armies of 20,000 men each, Genghis launched a successful attack against the Kara-Khitan Khanate, putting his reach of control right on Persia's doorstep.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rather than conquer the neighboring empire of Khwarezmia, Genghis instead offered a political alliance, sending a 500-man trade caravan to the capital - he hoped to create a powerful trading partner using the Silk Road.  However, the Khwarezmian Shah distrusted the young leader and slaughtered the caravan.  Trying once more, Genghis sent a group of ambassadors to the Shah directly, who answered the gesture by beheading one of them.  Outraged, Genghis assembled some 200,000 men and personally oversaw the bloody fall and abject subjugation of the Khwarezmian Empire in 1220. Immediately following his success he captured many other regions on his way back to Mongolia, including Georgia, Afghanistan, and the remaining Western Xia holdings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]His victorious journey complete, Genghis's empire now stretched from the Caspian Sea in the west all the way to the Sea of Japan in the east, twice the size of the Roman Empire.</Text>

			<Text>Now an aged man, the topic of Genghis's succession was heated and highly contested.  His eldest son, Jochi, was suspected of being born of a different man (as a result of his wife's capture), and many refused outright to follow him.  The clash ended however in 1226 when Jochi died mysteriously, some claiming that Genghis himself ordered the boy poisoned. His middle son Ogedei was named heir, as Genghis thought him the most level headed and stable of his remaining children.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shortly after in 1227 Genghis died, the reason for which is still debated. Some claim he fell from his horse during a battle against the Tangut people, others hold that he was struck down by a long illness.  Some even claim that a captured Tangut princess killed him with a pair of pliers.  Regardless of the means or reason, Genghis Khan was buried in an unmarked grave as he wished, its location a closely guarded family secret.  Some folklore claims that a river was diverted over the site to protect it; other stories describe a grove of trees planted atop the grave to hide it.  In 2004, an archaeological dig uncovered what is believed to be the ruins of Genghis' palace. Hope remains that his grave may yet be found.</Text>

During his reign, Bluetooth united the outlying tribes of Denmark and defended his people from the incursions of Norway and Germany, while overseeing the completion of vast construction projects that strengthened the defenses of his nation.

The son of King Gorm the Old and Queen Thyra Dannebod, Bluetooth was a born and raised Viking in the truest sense. Throughout his early years, Bluetooth and his brother Canute (also known as Knud) set sail to pillage and plunder, returning to their father with the spoils of war. It is believed that Canute, the first born and favored son of Gorm, was killed in England while raiding near Ireland. Canute's death left Bluetooth as the sole heir to the throne of Denmark.  With the death of Gorm in 958 AD, Bluetooth took up the throne and proved to be a capable leader both on and off the battlefield.</Text>

			<Text>Shortly after the death of his father, Bluetooth consolidated his power and quickly moved to unite the remaining discordant tribes of Denmark under one rule. Although his father Gorm is considered the first true King of Denmark, during his rule, the kingdom did not encompass the entire region, and independent tribes remained. Under Bluetooth, the entirety of Denmark, as well as parts of Norway and Sweden, fell under his rule. For a time, Bluetooth would even claim the title of King of Norway, although the extent of his authority there remains questionable.</Text>

			<Text>Bluetooth commissioned a number of important construction projects throughout Denmark during his reign. In this time, "Runestones" were a common form of monument used to honor the dead and acknowledge their deeds, and Bluetooth saw fit to honor his parents in this way. Commissioning a second Jelling Stone - runestones found in the town of Jelling, Denmark-  to memorialize his parents, Bluetooth created what is today considered the most well- known example of runic inscriptions in Denmark. Featuring an easily distinguished image of Christ on the cross, the Jelling Stone erected by Bluetooth is often referred to as the "Baptism Certificate of Denmark," signifying the end of the polytheistic traditions followed by much of the Danish population.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aside from the Jelling Stones, Bluetooth was also responsible for the development of a series of six Viking ring fortresses, known as the "Trelleborg." After losing control of several outlying territories to various Germanic forces, Bluetooth ordered the construction of these forts in strategic locations across Denmark in response. Capable of housing up to 500 Danish warriors, these strongholds succeeded in warding off further losses and secured the interior of Denmark from future incursions.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_HARALD_TEXT_5">
			<Text>Bluetooth's conversion to Christianity in approximately 960 AD is a point of contention among many modern historians, mainly due to variations in the story of how his conversion came to pass. The two most notable accounts of the event come to us from contemporary historians Widukind of Corvey and Adam of Bremen. Widukind wrote that Bluetooth was converted by a cleric known simply as "Poppa," who was either a guest of the court or a missionary who found his way to Denmark. Adam of Bremen (whose account was written some 100 years later) believed that Bluetooth had been converted forcibly by Otto I of Germany following a defeat in battle.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Regardless of how his conversion came to be, what we can say with certainty is that Harald became a devoted follower of Christianity, not only ensuring that Christian imagery was included on the Jelling Stone commemorating his parents, but also going so far as to remove his father's body from its traditional Viking burial mound and having it reburied under the church constructed by Bluetooth, where the Jelling Stones still stand today.</Text>

In the end, Bluetooth's own son, Sweyn, would rebel against him, forcing him to flee Denmark.

During the reign of the Chinese Qing Dynasty in the 19th century, trade relations with England dissolved amidst growing concern over the importation of Indian Opium into China. Britain had hoped to offset its increasing expensive tea imports from China by exporting greater amounts of Opium from its Indian colonies to China. However, the Qing rulers objected, and attempted to seize incoming opium shipments, inciting the First Opium War in 1839.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As one of the premier naval powers of the era, Britain had little trouble defeating the Chinese forces and occupying the island of Hong Kong.

After growing as a British colony for more than 150 years, Hong Kong was finally returned to China in 1997, after a peaceful transfer of power led to the creation of the Hong Kong special administrative region.

			<Text>Believed to have migrated from Mongolia and Central Asia, the Huns first crossed the Volga River sometime in the late 4th century. A region of great geographic diversity, the highly elevated, rugged plains of Mongolia are surrounded by mountainous forests, grasslands, deserts and hundreds of small lakes and marshes. The area is home to various species of wild horses, which surely contributed to the Huns equestrian mastery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At their height, the Huns controlled a wide range of territory across Central Europe, from the steppes of Central Asia to what is now modern Germany. This vast array of geographic and climatic variations seems to have had little effect on the Huns ability to rule such a broad swath of territory.</Text>

			<Text>A hotly contested topic, the true origin of the Huns eludes us even today. By most accounts, the Huns "came out of nowhere" and wreaked havoc on anyone they encountered. The Huns were possibly the descendants of the Xiongnu, a tribal confederation of equestrian nomads found in the northern regions of China. The Xiongnu frequently launched raids against the Chinese Qin Dynasty during the 3rd century BC, and, along with various other nomadic tribes, were part of the reason the Chinese built the Great Wall of China. The Huns appeared in parts of Europe just around the time the Xiongnu faded from sight, this mysterious arrival of a new society in the west, coinciding with the disappearance of another in the east, stands as one of the few links between the Huns and the Xiongnu.</Text>

			<Text>Early records of the Huns were far from impartial, having been written from the perspective of their numerous enemies, and leaving behind a spotty history of the Huns' initial conquests. Crossing into Europe in the 4th century, the Huns are said to have subjugated several rival tribes including the Alans, the Ostrogoths, and the Visigoths. While still only loosely united at this point, the Huns also boldly attacked portions of both the Eastern and Western Roman Empire, while also working as mercenaries for Rome against other tribes, successfully playing both sides of the field. It was during this period that the Byzantines (the Eastern Romans) began paying tribute to the Huns in order to secure peaceful relations, although the Romans often failed to meet their obligations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The history of the Huns becomes more certain in the time directly before the rule of Attila. Preceding him was his uncle Rua, who gradually established complete control over the diverse Hunnic forces and eliminated all opposing leadership. Rua maintained an iron-fisted rule over the Huns and launched a number of successful attacks against neighboring tribes before setting his sights on bigger objectives.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ruling as King of the Hun Confederation - as it became known at this point in history - Rua initiated a number of conflicts with the Eastern Roman Empire. It seems that several of the tribes previously subjugated by the Huns fled to the Byzantines in the hopes of seeking asylum. Rua, demanding they be turned over, set his armies loose on the Byzantine territory and pillaged Thrace, to the northwest of Constantinople. However, in the midst of his campaign, Rua was killed, allegedly after being struck by lightning, and the Huns were forced to retreat.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_HUNS_TEXT_5">
			<Text>Following Rua's death in 434, Attila and his brother Bleda shared a dual kingship, continuing the expansion of Hun territory across Europe. Sustained primarily by a steady income of tribute and plunder, the Huns became an increasingly powerful force on the European continent in the 5th century. The Roman General Aetius, who had previously allied with Rua and used the Huns to aid in securing his position as commander of the Roman troops in Gaul, again hired the Huns to serve as mercenaries in his campaign against the Burgundian raiders attacking the northern Roman provinces.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Flush with wealth, the Huns once again moved on the Eastern Roman Empire (a favored target of their campaigns) and intimidated the weakened Byzantine leadership into signing the Treaty of Margus in 435. This treaty was said to have doubled the previous tribute due from the Byzantines - which was already several hundred pounds of gold per year - further increasing the resources of the Huns. As was the case in the past, the Byzantines failed to meet their obligations and delivered no tribute, and as before, the Huns returned to the Eastern Roman territory and sacked a number of cities, eventually reaching Constantinople in 443. The Byzantines once again agreed to deliver substantial tribute, this time triple the original amount, and the Huns took them at their word and withdrew.</Text>

			<Text>Attila's brother Bleda died in 445, and Attila became sole ruler of the Hunnic Empire. By 447, Attila had defeated the Eastern Roman armies and captured a number of Roman forts, gaining control of the Balkans. The Romans again tried to ply the Huns with tribute, and for a time, they actually paid it ... at least until Attila had focused his attention elsewhere.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 451, Attila invaded Gaul, attacking a number of cities en route to Orleans. Ironically, the Huns early benefactor, Roman General Aetius was now forced to face them head-on in defense of Gaul. Leading a combined force of Romans and Visigoths, General Aetius and his army met Attila at The Battle of Catalaunian Plains and managed to rebuff the Huns. Suffering the first major defeat of his career as a military commander, Attila was forced to withdraw from Gaul and regroup. Always the ambitious conqueror, Attila moved his forces east with the intention of striking Italy and the heart of the Romans.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sacking various cities in northern Italy, Attila never made his way to Rome. Although some historians believe it was the intervention of Pope Leo I who convinced Attila not to march further, others claim it was the threat of reinforcements from the Eastern Roman Empire that truly swayed his decision. Shortly thereafter in 453, Attila died unceremoniously on his wedding night, falling to, some historians claim, a simple nosebleed. Without the forceful leadership of the charismatic Attila and his legendary reputation, the Huns mystique as an unstoppable force was broken.</Text>

			<Text>Following Attila's death, the Hunnic Empire was to be ruled by his oldest son Ellac. However, Attila's other sons, Dengizich and Irnk, also sought the throne and internal divisions within the empire quickly brought about its downfall. Only a year after his reign began, Ellac was killed at The Battle of Nedao in 454, during which the Huns were soundly defeated by an army of united Germanic tribes. After his brother's death, Dengizich secured the throne for a brief rule, but the Huns, now in an increasing state of disarray, soon vanished from history as quickly as they had arrived. When Dengizich died in 469, it is thought that the remaining Hunnic people began to migrate back towards their ancestral lands on the Central Asian steppe.</Text>

			<Text>Although mysterious in origin, by most accounts, the Huns ate, slept, and died on horseback, which helps explain why they were known throughout history for their expertise in mounted combat and equestrianism. Sustained primarily by their efforts as herdsmen and shepherds, the Huns kept a variety of livestock that provided mobile food sources as well as hides for clothing. They were also gifted archers who would hone their skills through frequent hunts, employing specially crafted composite bows that made them deadly to adversary and prey alike.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite their legacy as conquerors, the Huns also had skilled craftsmen and artisans among their people. A number of bronze artifacts attributed to the Huns have been found within the regions they once inhabited, including bronze cauldrons thought to have been used in Hunnic burial rituals.</Text>

			<Text>The battering ram was a siege warfare device primarily utilized during the ancient era.  Designed with a singular purpose in mind, battering rams were used to crash through the heavy wooden gates used during this period. Although there were varying shapes and forms found among the many battering ram designs, all shared the same general principle. Mounted on a cart or other wheeled platform, a heavy log or post was slung using chains or ropes. Soldiers manning the ram would then pull back on the log, releasing it with enough force to splinter the enemy's gate. Although the specific details surrounding the Huns implementation of this siege weapon are scarce, it is known that they successfully deployed battering rams against a number of major European cities during their conquest.</Text>

Utilizing powerful composite bows, the mounted archers of the Huns honed their skills while hunting on the Central Asian Steppe, and they had no trouble carrying over these skills into warfare. It is widely believed that the Huns' use of mounted archers greatly influenced the future military considerations of both European and Asian kingdoms, as a greater emphasis on cavalry units arose following their incursions.</Text>

			<Text>According to ancient legends, the holy city of Ife is the birthplace of the Yoruba, the largest ethnic group in West Africa. In their mythology, Ife was the place where Oduduwa, brother to the supreme god Obatala, climbed down from the heavens and threw a handful of dirt on the primordial ocean, thus creating the land on which Ife would stand. The meaning of the word "ife" in Yoruba is "expansion," and the city is believed not only the birthplace of the Yoruba but of all mankind.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whatever the truth of its founding, by the 11th Century AD Ife was the capital of a well-established kingdom spanning what is now Nigeria. Within a century, the city was exerting considerable religious and political influence in the area, especially over the Edo kingdom of Benin to the southeast. Although the Yoruba cities of Benin and Oyo would become more politically significant states, Ife remained the spiritual center. Ife managed to avoid the attacks by the Islamic Fulani that toppled Oyo, but was weakened by struggles with Owu to the southwest in the 1820s for control of the slave trade. In 1882, Ife was largely destroyed when a combined army of Ibadan and Modakeke warriors sacked the holy city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although Ife remained a city holy to the Yoruba, its political influence was ended by 1900 AD. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the British established a series of ports and trading posts in West Africa. In 1885, British claims to a West African sphere of influence were recognized formally by the other European powers, and the following year the Royal Niger Company was chartered by the crown. Nigeria remained part of the British Empire until it gained independence in 1960. During the colonial period, Ife was largely ignored except by European scholars and Yoruba pilgrims.</Text>

During the 15th and 16th centuries, a chain of over 50 feitoria were built along the coasts of west and east Africa, India, Malaya, China and Japan. The feitoria allowed Portugal to dominate the Atlantic and Indian Ocean trade routes for three centuries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A Feitoria can only be built in a City-State's lands, on a coastal tile without a resource.

			<Text>A polder is a low-lying tract enclosed by dikes with the water drained. In general, polder is land reclaimed from a lake or seabed, from flood plains, or from marshes. In time, the drained land subsides so that all polder is eventually below the surrounding water level. Because of this, water seeps into the drained area and must be pumped out or otherwise drained. The dikes are usually made of readily available materials, earth or sand; in modern times these barriers might be covered or completely composed of concrete. The drained land is extremely fertile and makes excellent pasturage or cropland.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first polders of reclaimed land were constructed in the 11th Century AD, although building embankments as barriers to water date back to the Romans. The Dutch have a long history of reclaiming marshes and fenland, and even the seabed, and possess half of the polder acreage in Europe. Although there are polders in other countries of Europe, and examples can be found in Asia and North America, Holland has some 3000 polders accounting for about 27 percent of the country's land. Amsterdam itself is built largely upon polder. As the Dutch homily states, "God made the world, but the Dutch made Holland."</Text>

These skinny, stepped fields are cut into hill and mountain sides, preventing the run off of irrigation water and providing space for arable land, usually where none previously was possible. The Incas in particular were masters of terrace farming, and erected large, drystone walls to hold their terraces in place.  After building the terrace's shape, the Incas then constructed systems of canals and aqueducts to provide the terraces with constant water, increasing the land's fertility.

Using both military conquests and peaceful assimilations, Pachacuti and his son Tupac laid the foundation for the Tahuantinsuyu Empire.

Huayna's two sons, Huascar and Atahualpa, were engaged in a civil war over control of the territories, and the introduction of smallpox had wreaked considerable havoc among its populace.  Pizarro's force (168 men, 1 cannon, and 27 horses) were no match for the Inca in numbers, but their superior technology and military tactics saw them through in the end.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pizarro's first battle, the Battle of Pun, occurred later that year near present-day Guayaquil, Ecuador, which he handily won.  One of his men, Hernando de Soto, was sent further inland to explore as Pizarro founded a new city in the area, Piura. De Soto encountered the triumphant Atahualpa and returned to Pizarro with an invitation to meet. The Spaniards demanded that the Incas accept Charles I of Spain as their emperor and convert immediately to Christianity.  Perhaps due to a language barrier or poor communication skills in general, Atahualpa didn't fully grasp the exact message of the meeting and sent further communications demanding more explanation.  Frustrated and annoyed, instead of finding a better translator the Spanish attacked Atahualpa's camp and took the leader as hostage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Incan King offered Pizarro a massive amount of gold and silver for his release, which he promptly accepted. Pizarro however didn't keep his end of the bargain and refused to release Atahualpa to the Incas.  During this time, Huascar was assassinated and Pizarro used this to his advantage - claiming that Atahualpa was behind the dirty deed.  At a shady trial run by the Spanish, Atahualpa was sentenced to death in August 1533.</Text>

			<Text>With both Atahualpa and Huascar out of the picture, the Spanish placed their younger brother Manco in charge, who dutifully cooperated with them for the time being. Manco, once secure in his own power base, attempted to take back his empire with the capture of Cusco in 1536, but he was no match for the Spanish invaders. He and his court fled to the mountains of Peru, where they continued to rule for the next 36 years.  However, in 1572 the last Incan stronghold fell, and Manco's son and current king, Tupac Amaru was executed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All the Incan royalty dead, the new Spanish rulers brutally oppressed the native people and attempted to strip them of their culture, religion, and traditions. Each Incan family was required to send a family member to work in the Spanish gold and silver mines, and replace them immediately upon the worker's death, which happened roughly every one to two years due to poor working conditions. Smallpox continued to spread rapidly through the remains of the empire, claiming somewhere between 60% and 90% of the population.  Typhus, influenza, diphtheria, and measles did the rest - by 1618 almost all traces of the Incan culture were lost. All that is left now of their once glorious civilization is a smattering of scattered tribes and stone outcroppings, relics of a distant past.</Text>

			<Text>The kris is a long-bladed, asymmetrical dagger or sword with a distinctive wavy blade common to Indonesia and Malaya. Both weapon and mystical object, kris were believed by the Indonesian tribes to have an essence imbued with magical power, with some blades bringing good luck and others bad. So prized was the kris in Indonesia that heirloom blades were handed down through successive generations. In battle, a kris swordsman might carry as many as three: his own, one from his father-in-law, and one family heirloom. The forging of kris blades was restricted to a select few, and these skilled metalworkers made the blades in layers of different iron ores and meteorite nickel folded many times, a process that could take years to complete.</Text>

			<Text>The history of the 18,307 islands that comprise the Indonesian archipelago is actually that of hundreds of city-states, small kingdoms, and occasional empires. The first of which is thought to be the kingdom of Dvipantara mentioned in the Indian epic Ramayama, composed c. 200 BC. The last significant Hindu kingdom, the Majapahit Empire, unified most of the archipelago in the 13th Century AD. There followed a succession of Islamic sultanates which dominated the major islands until the arrival of European explorers and traders. Known as the "Spice Islands" to the Europeans, lying astride trade routes between the Far East and the West, the Portuguese, Spanish, British and Dutch vied for control of the island chain until the Dutch East India Company came to rule Indonesia. Despite a four-year armed struggle for independence against the Dutch following the Second World War, and periods of unrest since, the country is now more stable, progressive and harmonious than ever, despite occasional outbreaks of sectarian and political violence. Reflecting the ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic pluralism that resulted from this contentious past is Indonesia's national motto: Bhinneka Tunggal Ika ("Unity in Diversity").</Text>

			<Text>Indonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia, consisting of over 18000 islands scattered along the equator between the Indian and Pacific oceans. Of these, according to 2002 Indonesian government sources, 8844 islands have been named, with 922 of those having some permanent settlement thereon. The chain is approximately 3200 miles in length, the equivalent of one-eighth of the Earth's circumference. The major islands are characterized by densely forested mountains in the interior sloping down to alluvial swamps and jungles along the coastlines. The smaller ones range from jungle-covered volcanic peaks to barren sand islets. The chain lies atop the juncture of three major crustal plates, and Indonesia's history has been marred by volcanic eruptions and severe earthquakes. Given its location, Indonesia has a tropical climate, marked by two monsoon seasons. Average rainfall in the lower elevations ranges from 70 to 125 inches annually, while the mountain slopes receive up to 240 inches. Temperature varies little; the daily range in the capital is 79-86 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the year. Although extremely fertile and surrounded by rich coastal shallows, the islands are subject to frequent typhoons and gales.</Text>

			<Text>Fossilized bones of Homo erectus, a possible ancestor of humans popularly known as "Java Man," were discovered by Dutch scientists in 1891 AD and have been dated to be at least 700 thousand years old. The archipelago was formed by the thaw following the last great ice age, and Homo sapiens crossed to the islands some 45,000 years ago. An ideal climate and the development of wet-field rice cultivation led to the first human settlements c. 8th Century BC, and the initial "kingdoms" - little more than collections of villages with common ethnic and linguistic backgrounds - arose during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first record of an indigenous kingdom is that referring to Dvipantara in India's earliest epic, the Ramayana (c. 200 BC); in it the general Sugriva dispatches troops in search of the god Rama's consort Sita there. From descriptions in the epic, Dvipantara lay on either Java or Sumatra. The earliest archeological evidence of any cohesive kingdom is located in west Java, where a statue of the Hindu deity Ganesha dates to the 1st Century AD. Around the same time, the Roman historian Pliny the Elder writes that Indonesian boats were engaged in trade along the east coast of Africa. The next century, the geographer Ptolemy incorporated information from Indian sources about the islands in his Geographike Hyphegesis.</Text>

			<Text>In the following centuries, a number of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished and then collapsed. By 850 AD the Medang kingdom had attained dominance on Java, and even challenged the hegemony of the powerful Srivijaya Empire. Little is known of Medang save for scattered Sanskrit inscriptions related to Sri Sanjaya, who founded the dynasty c. 730 AD, and the king Dharmawangsa, who launched a naval invasion of Srivijaya lands in Sumatra in 990 AD. Dharmawangsa was killed in 1006 when the Srivijaya retaliated, sacking his palace and destroying the Medang kingdom.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Srivijaya was an ethnic Malay kingdom centered on Palembang in Sumatra, a thalassocracy founded on maritime trade and naval power. Without a central government in the modern sense, it was a loose confederation centered on a royal heartland, with various colonies and vassal states. Focused on the spice trade, by the 7th Century AD Srivijaya controlled most of the coastal areas of Sumatra, Java and the Malay Peninsula and dominated the Sunda and Malacca straits. Although its hegemony had waned by the 11th Century, it remained a formidable sea power until the 1300s. But gradually, various portions gained independence as regional kingdoms. Srivijaya ceased to exist when its last king converted to Islam, fled a Majapahit invasion in 1398 AD, and founded the Moslem sultanate of Malacca based on his new stronghold at the mouth of the Betram River in 1402.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the ruins of Srivijaya arose the kingdoms of Singhasari and Majapahit on Java. The history of the kingdom of Singhasari commences with the probably mythic account of Ken Arok, who founded his dynasty c. 1182 AD. By 1280 the Singhsari had erased the last vestiges of Srivijaya, but had drawn the attention of emperor Kublai Khan. The great Khan sent envoys to the court of king Kertanegara to demand Singharari's submission and tribute; rebuffed, Kublai sent delegations with the same demands again in 1281 and 1289 - with worse results, as his ambassador was mutilated on the king's orders. Enraged, Kublai Khan dispatched a fleet of 1000 warships carrying an invasion force. Taking advantage of the situation, a number of Singhararin vassals rebelled. In the ensuing chaos, Singharari collapsed, Kertanegara was killed, the Mongols driven out - making the Indonesians one of the few peoples to resist a Mongol onslaught - and the king's son-in-law, Raden Wijaya, established the Majapahit kingdom in 1293 AD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite the lack of documentary evidence, it is known that Majapahit was the most powerful of the pre-Islamic kingdoms. Two generations after the founding of Majapahit, its ambitious Prime Minister Gajah Mada extended its rule over most of the archipelago before his disgrace and downfall. Successive Majapahit emperors would complete the task Gajah Mada had begun, eventually unifying what is now Indonesia. Although the Majapahit rulers toppled neighboring dynasties and conquered vast areas, their focus seems to have been on controlling the rich and growing commercial trade of the region. In the process, Muslim traders and missionaries entered. After its peak in the 14th Century, Majapahit influence declined precipitously. Unable to thwart the rising power of the Malacca sultanate, the Majapahit Empire ended around 1520 AD.</Text>

			<Text>Although the spread of Islam across Indonesia commences in the 1200s in Sumatra, it became a tidal wave under tolerant Majapahit emperors. Its spread was driven by increasing trade; in general, traders and the nobility of Majapahit holdings were the first to adopt the new religion. By the 16th Century, it was the dominant faith in Sumatra and Java, mixing with existing cultural and religious beliefs, creating a Muslim faith particular to Indonesia. Only Bali and a few smaller islands would retain a Hindu majority.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Along with the powerful Sultanate of Malacca, two other long-lived Islamic kingdoms dominated the islands until the arrival of the Europeans: the Sultanate of Mataram on Java, and the Sultanate of Banten, which controlled the Sunda Strait. Throughout most of their existence, the Islamic sultanates were immensely rich from the spice and silk trades, ruled by patrons of the arts and sciences, guarded by well-captained navies. But the arrival of the Portuguese, soon followed by other colonial powers, saw the submission of the various Islamic states to ruthless exploiters with better technology.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]First to fall was Malacca, captured by Portuguese forces led by Alfonso de Albuquerque in August 1511. In 1603, the Dutch East India Company established its first permanent trading post in Indonesia in Banten; after two centuries of conflict and interference, the governor-general of the Dutch announced from his headquarters in Serang that the Sultanate of Banten had been absorbed into the company's holdings. In the meantime, taking advantage of dynastic struggles in the Sultanate of Mataran, the Dutch had forced the aged and ill Sultan Pakubuwana signed an agreement in 1749 AD through which sovereignty of the kingdom was ceded to the company. After the Portuguese handed Malacca over to the Dutch, the Dutch East India Company "owned" the Spice Islands.</Text>

			<Text>After the Dutch East India Company dissolved in bankruptcy in 1800 AD, the Dutch government took over administration of its holdings in Indonesia. For most of the following 150 years, Dutch rule was relatively benign but tenuous. However, a policy of forced cultivation of cash crops and the introduction of indentured labor which forced peasants to work government-owned plantations 60 days each year led to widespread unrest. Furthermore, the Dutch colonists formed a privileged upper class, codified by laws establishing two legal categories of citizens, European and indigenous, with differing rights. The unrest in Indonesia brought the Dutch to modest political reforms in 1901, embodied in the "Ethical Policy" which included increased investment in native education and changes in property laws. Significant Dutch investment in the infrastructure of the country - notably in ports and roads - with the goal of modernizing the economy also quieted nationalistic movements ... but only for a time.</Text>

			<Text>Dutch rule collapsed in the face of Japanese invasion and occupation in 1942 AD. The events of World War II fanned the flames of nationalism that had arisen in the country in the previous four decades. The first nationalist movement, the Budi Utomo, had coalesced as early as 1908; the first Indonesian political party, Sarekat Islam, was founded in 1912. The latter was followed by the Indies Social Democratic Association, which would evolve into the Communist Party of Indonesia in 1924. Finally, in July 1927, the pro-independence Partai Nasional Indonesia was formed by Sukarno (who would become Indonesia's first president) and other liberals. Following an abortive revolt led by the Communists, Sukarno and most other nationalist leaders were arrested.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In July 1942, Sukarno accepted Japan's offer to rally public support for the Japanese war effort. Japan's occupation was often brutal, with torture and forced labor in some instances; but many of the nationalists continued to cooperate in hopes of attaining their goal of independence promised by the Japanese administrators. In March 1945, in the face of a military defeat, Japan announced the formation of a committee to institute Indonesian independence. But events overtook the committee. Two days after the Japanese surrender to Allied forces, Sukarno unilaterally declared Indonesia free of colonial rule. The Netherlands, initially backed by Great Britain, attempted to re-establish their domination and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ensured. The fight did not end until the Dutch, in the face of growing international pressure, formally recognized Indonesian independence.</Text>

			<Text>Sukarno and his supporters tried to institute a Western-styled democratic government for the new state in the 1945 and 1950 constitutions, which mandated a parliamentary style of government with the executive branch responsible to the elected parliament. But, with Indonesia suffering from extreme poverty, authoritarian traditions, regional differences and fears of Javanese political domination, Sukarno proclaimed that the country would instead adopt what he termed a "Guided Democracy." In July 1959, Sukarno abrogated the 1950 Constitution, dissolved parliament, and replaced it with one appointed by and subject to the will of the President.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1967, following a coup engineered by the military, Sukarno was forced to resign in favor the general Suharto, Indonesia's second president. In power as a virtual dictator for the next 31 years, Suharto struggled to suppress dissent, stabilize the economy and foreign policy, and navigate the Cold War. Marked by growing corruption and civil rights abuses, his administration finally collapsed in the face of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In exchange for a $43 billion bailout by the United States, Suharto agreed to wide-sweeping reforms. But again events would overtake the movement for freedom; a student-led uprising forced Suharto to resign in May 1998. In 1999, the reconstituted national parliament elected Abdurrahman Wahid president, the first in a line of democracy-minded reformers to lead Indonesia into the future.</Text>

			<Text>Isabella was born on April 22, 1451 in vila to John II of Castile and Isabella of Portugal.  She had an older brother, Henry (her elder by 26 years), and later a younger brother Alfonso, who displaced her in the line of succession.  When her father died in 1454, Henry took the throne of Castile as King Henry IV, and Isabella and her family moved to Arvalo and lived in a destitute castle, where her mother slowly started to lose her sanity. It wasn't until years later, when Henry's wife gave birth, that Henry allowed his siblings to move back to the main court in Segovia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Here Isabella was educated in all manners of queenly disciplines and her life improved considerably, but Henry did put one limiting condition on her - she was forbidden to leave Segovia without his permission.  Henry claimed this was to keep Isabella from the political turmoil brewing in the kingdom over his choice of heir (his new daughter Joanna), but it could have also been to restrict her access to the rebelling noblemen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The nobles, however, had no problem speaking with her younger brother Alfonso, and he instigated the Second Battle of Olmedo in 1467, demanding that he be made Henry's heir.  As a compromise, Henry named Alfonso the Prince of Asturias, a title that would be given to the heir apparent of both Castile and Leon, and thought about marrying his daughter Joanna to Alfonso.  But Alfonso didn't have long to enjoy his new role; he soon died, probably a casualty of the plague.  Alfonso had named Isabella his successor in his will, and the title passed to her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rather than continue the rebellion against her older brother, Isabella met with Henry at Toros de Guisando and negotiated a permanent peace settlement. Henry would officially name Isabella as his heir, but she would not be allowed to marry without his consent.  However, Henry could also not force her to marry against her will.  Both parties pleased with their settlement, Henry began his search for a fitting husband for his younger sister.</Text>

			<Text>At this time, Isabella was betrothed to Ferdinand, son of John II of Aragon (and had been since the age of three), but Henry broke off this agreement.  Instead, he attempted to wed Isabella to Charles IV of Navarre, another of John's sons, but John refused the offer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Soon after in 1464, Henry attempted to marry Isabella off to King Edward IV of England, but Edward also refused.  Many attempts were then made to wed the girl to Alfonso V of Portugal, but she refused him at the altar due to his old age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Castilian's personal soap opera continued with Isabella's betrothal to Pedro Giron, the brother of Henry's favorite Don.  Isabella prayed feverishly that the marriage be called off, as Don Pedro was 27years older than she.  Isabella fervently believed that God had answered her plea, as the Don died from a burst appendix on the way to greet his fiance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Next up in Henry's shrinking line of suitors was Louis XI's brother Charles, Duke of Berry.  At this point Isabella had had enough of Henry's thinly veiled attempts to remove her from the line of succession with a poor political marriage, and she began to negotiate with John II of Aragon in secret to once again secure a marriage to his son Ferdinand.</Text>

			<Text>Although all parties were in favor of the marriage of Isabella and Ferdinand (except of course for Henry, who was still trying to woo France and Portugal), there was one small problem - the young couple were second cousins.  By church law, a Papal Bull was required for a wedding of closely related cousins, but the Pope was loathe to grant one from fear of retribution from Castile, Portugal, and France.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, Isabella refused to marry without the dispensation, as she was by this point a very devout woman.  Ferdinand sought the help of Rodrigo Borgia in Rome (later Pope Alexander VI) and presented Isabella with a "Papal Bull" from Pius II.  The probable forgery was good enough for her and she quickly agreed to the marriage.  With the excuse of visiting her brother's tomb in Avila, Isabella managed to escape Henry's sight and Ferdinand slipped into Castile disguised as a merchant.  Isabella's rather Shakespearian journey ended on October 19, 1469 when she wedded Ferdinand in Valladolid.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Henry found out about the marriage rather quickly after this, and pleaded with the Pope to dissolve the marriage.  The new Pope, Sixtus IV, didn't have any of his predecessor's qualms about Castilian hostilities and instead gifted the wedded couple a real Papal Bull, thwarting Henry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A few years later in 1474, Henry died and a succession war broke out across Castile.  Portugal supported Henry's daughter, Joanna, to take the throne, but Isabella had the support of Aragon (through Ferdinand) and later France.  The war dragged on for four years, but ultimately Sixtus IV again came to Isabella's rescue. The Pope annulled Joanna's marriage to Alfonso V of Portugal, ironically on the grounds of their close familial relationship.  Joanna was forced to renounce her titles of Princess and Queen of Castile, and the throne passed to Isabella on January 20, 1479.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The early years of Isabella's reign mostly involved solidifying her power base and continuing the Reconquista (Recapturing) of the Iberian Peninsula.  However, her reign became memorable, in the momentous year of 1492.</Text>

			<Text>Almost everything Isabella is known for in history took place in this year: the end of the Reconquista, the patronage of Christopher Columbus, and the intensification of the Inquisition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Spanning seven centuries, a lengthy war known as the Reconquista was fought by the Iberian monarchs, who were attempting to regain control of the region and force the Muslims out.  For the last 200 of these years, the Emirate of Granada remained the final stronghold of the Muslim dynasties on the Iberian Peninsula. Isabella and Ferdinand continued the war and led a determined raid into the kingdom starting in 1482.  Isabella often took it upon herself to rally her soldiers by praying in the middle of the battlefield, and even built her stronghold outside the city of Granada in the shape of a cross, believing she was doing God's will.  Eventually Isabella's forces were victorious and she signed the Treaty of Granada, ending the Reconquista after 700 years of fighting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Earlier in her reign, Isabella had been approached by a young explorer by the name of Christopher Columbus, who sought funding for a new expedition to reach the Indies by sailing west.  Her advisors judged his plan impractical and believed that his proposed distance to Asia was much too short to be possible.  However, instead of turning him out as Portugal had done, Isabella gave him a small annual allowance and free lodging in all her cities.  He continued to try and sell his plan to the monarchs, and they continued to decline.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Upon returning from Granada, Isabella was again approached by Christopher Columbus.  On the advice of her confessor, Isabella this time firmly turned him down.  As Columbus was leaving Crdoba in despair, Ferdinand quickly convinced Isabella to change her mind.  She sent a royal guard to fetch him and began to draw up plans for funding.  Columbus left on his fateful voyage on August 3, 1492, and landed in America on October 12. Isabella and Ferdinand's patronage of the intrepid explorer began Spain's Golden Age of exploration and colonization.</Text>

			<Text>The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Spain (or more succinctly, the Spanish Inquisition) was established in 1478 by Isabella to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in Castile and Aragon, and to replace the Medieval Inquisition currently under Papal control.  However, in 1492, it took a turn for the worse.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A Dominican friar, Toms de Torquemada became the first Inquisitor General and pushed the two monarchs to pursue a more active policy of religious unity.  While Isabella was loathe to take harsh measures against the Jews in her kingdom (for purely economic reasons), Torquemada was able to convince Ferdinand and through him, Isabella.  The Alhambra Decree was signed on March 31, 1492, calling for the forced expulsion of the Jews. About 200,000 Jews immediately left Spain while  some others converted, but this latter group fell under strict scrutiny of the Inquisition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Muslims in the Granada region, who had originally been granted religious freedoms, were pressured to convert.  After many Muslims revolted, a policy was enacted to force conversion or expulsion, much like with the Jews.</Text>

			<Text>Isabella continued to stabilize her growing empire throughout her reign, and worked to link her children with other European nations, hoping to avoid another succession war similar to her own.  She strived to finally unite the Iberian Peninsula under one crown. She married her eldest son to an Austrian Archduchess, establishing a link to the Habsburgs, and her eldest daughter to Manual I of Portugal. However, Isabella's plans were laid to waste when both children died soon after and the crown passed to her third daughter, Joanna the Mad. Joanna married Philip of Burgundy and became the last Trastmaran monarch.   After her, the crown passed to the Habsburgs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Isabella died in 1504 and was entombed in the Royal Chapel of Granada.</Text>

Although many criticize her role in the Inquisition and in the persecution of Jews and Muslims, others are currently campaigning to have the late Queen canonized as a Saint in the Catholic Church.

Since the first settlements in the area of Jakarta were laid by Hindu pilgrims in the 4th century AD, the city has been known by many names, and controlled by an equally extensive number of empires. For nearly 1,000 years, Jakarta was part of the Kingdom of Sunda, who ruled a number of surrounding territories along the Indian Ocean. With the arrival of Portuguese explorers in the 16 century, the lucrative spice trade was quickly established with Jakarta being the primary port in the region.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Kingdom of Sunda eventually fell to the Muslim Sultanate of Fatahillah, who also expelled the Portuguese from the region. However, trade routes were reestablished soon after with the arrival of Dutch and English traders, including the influential English East India Company. After repeated conflicts between the two colonial powers vying for trade dominance, the Dutch and their own East India Company emerged victorious.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Dutch East India Company remained the dominant trading power in the region's islands until its eventual dissolution in 1800, when the Dutch formally declared the formation of the Dutch East Indies, which covered much of the area known today as Indonesia. In 1950, the efforts of Indonesian nationalists succeeded in gaining full independence for the nation, with Jakarta established as its capital. Although the city and its residents have often been enveloped in political unrest and instability, the economy of Jakarta continues to grow as foreign investors seek new markets for development.</Text>

			<Text>The often contentious debate over Jerusalem, holy city to the followers of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, has raged for decades since the city's establishment as the capital of Israel. With portions of the city having been constructed over 6,000 years ago, Jerusalem is one of the oldest known cities in the world. Throughout its tumultuous history, Jerusalem has come under siege numerous times, as far-reaching empires and local kingdoms alike struggled to wrest control of the city from one another.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The oldest area in Jerusalem, the City of David, is said to have been founded by the legendary King David sometime during the 1st millennium BC. Over the centuries that followed, immigrants and refugees toiling under a number of kings and emperors worked to expand the city. By the time the Islamic Caliphates rose to power in the 6th century AD, Jerusalem had already been controlled by the Macedonians, the Romans, and the Byzantine Empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The past century has arguably been the most controversial in Jerusalem's history, following the establishment of the Jewish state of Israel and Israel's subsequent annexation of Jerusalem following the Six-Day War. In the time since, Israel's control of Jerusalem has been one of the major hurdles preventing a resolution to the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</Text>

			<Text>To his fellow Afghans, Abed Rahmani wrote, "Be united like a rain; be powerful like an ocean." The people of Kabul, largest city in Afghanistan, having weathered repeated imperial invasions to retain their distinctive culture and identity, can be said to have done that. Wedged in a valley in the Hindu Kush, Kabul occupies a strategic location on the route between south and central Asia, controlling the approaches to the Khyber Pass. The city serves as Afghanistan's cultural and educational center; although the conflicts beginning in 1978 crippled Kabul's influence, since the ascension of the Karzai administration in 2001, progress has been made in returning the capital to its historic role in the cultural and political life of the Hindu Kush.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kabul is over 3500 years old, but rarely free. The Hindu Rigveda praised it as the ideal city, a "vision of paradise set in the mountains." Late in the Achaemenid Era, the city became a center for Zoroastrianism. Numerous kingdoms and empires held Kabul over the next dozen centuries. In 1504 the city was taken by Babur, who made it his headquarters as he carved out the Mughal Empire. Babur so loved the city he lived in for two decades that his tomb carried an inscription in Persian reading: "If there is a paradise on earth, this is it, this is it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Free at last when the 20th Century dawned, Kabul experienced a renaissance that spanned 60 years. During the 40-year rule of the liberal Mohammed Zahir Shah, European investments helped develop a modern network of communication and transportation. The ten-year Soviet occupation ended in civil war in 1989, resulting in the repressive Taliban-controlled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Not until an American-led coalition established a new democratic government did Kabul begin to reassert its historic cultural identity.</Text>

			<Text>One of the most respected leaders in Hawaiian history, Kamehameha I was the first man to unify all the Hawaiian Islands, establishing the independent Kingdom of Hawai'i.  His birth and early actions in life fulfilled many ancient Hawaiian prophecies, and he became one of the greatest warriors in recorded Hawaiian history.  Beyond his military prowess, Kamehameha was also a great statesman, and established important wartime edicts which have become the basis for many humanitarian laws around the world.</Text>

			<Text>Ancient legend held that one day a great king would be born who would unite the whole of the Hawaiian Islands, and a flame across the heavens would herald his coming.  In 1758, Hailey's comet streaked across the sky of Hawai'i - many accounts state that Kamehameha was born shortly thereafter.  Known originally as Pai'ea (the "hard-shelled crab"), Kamehameha was born to Chief Ke?ua Nui of the Big Island.  Ke?ua was but one of many lesser chiefs on the island, which had been split into multiple districts during a succession war in the previous generation. Alapa'inuiakauaua, a rival chief in the area, had reclaimed much of the island for himself, and was the defacto ruler.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At news of Pai'ea's birth Alapa'i became alarmed, for the great king of legend was also known in other records as the "killer of chiefs" - a unified Hawai'i wouldn't need tribal chiefs any longer. Alapa'i ordered the child slain.  Ke?ua, however, was well aware of his child's ominous birth and hid him away with another noble family.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For five years Pai'ea lived in secret, until Alapa'i (for reasons unknown) invited the child to return to the court under his protection.  During this time at the court, Pai'ea learned the kingly disciplines of diplomacy and war and earned his more famous name, Kamehameha, meaning "the lonely one".</Text>

			<Text>After Alapa'i's death, Kamehameha became an aide in the new chief's court.  This lasted until 1782, when the kingship moved on to a new ruler and Kamehameha was promoted to an important religious position.  With this new found power, Kamehameha began to build himself a support base among the lesser chiefs of the Kona district of the Big Island.  Eventually garnering the support of five chiefs, Kamehameha challenged the local court.  At the battle of Moku'ohai, Kamehameha's forces defeated the ruling chief and Kamehameha became the new ruler of the Kohala, Kona, and Hamakua districts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]From here, Kamehameha successfully conquered the neighboring district of Puna in 1790, but soon had to face an uprising in Ka'u led by rival Ke?ua Kuahu'ula. Ever a religious man, Kamehameha constructed a large temple in a bid to gain the favor of his gods and the divine blessing to quash the rebellion.  In 1791 the temple was finished, and Kamehamea invited Ke?ua to meet with him.  Accounts differ on exactly what happened at that fateful meeting on the beach, but in the end Ke?ua was killed by musket fire and Kamehameha became the King of all the Big Island.</Text>

			<Text>Kamehameha was driven to unite more than just the Big Island - he had his sights on ruling all of the Hawaiian Islands under one banner.  Adding fuel to his wish was another ancient legend, one which he was purported to have fulfilled.  On the Big Island a massive boulder was placed by the gods - the 3,000 pound Naha Stone.  Legend stated that a mighty warrior would emerge one day who could lift it, and he would be known as the great king and unifier of all the islands.  At age 14, Kamehameha was recorded as the only person to accomplish this feat.  Confident from his round of victories and multiple fulfilled prophecies, he began to lay the plans for the rest of the islands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In a happy coincidence for Kamehameha, British and American traders began to arrive on the island and gladly sold him guns and ammunition. With his technologically superior weapons, he quickly moved to take Maui and O'ahu in 1795.  With only 10,000 soldiers he quickly decimated Maui's forces and moved onto O'ahu.  He met with fierce resistance at the cliffs of Pali (mostly from a defected commander), but in the end he defeated the enemy soldiers, driving many over the deadly cliff's edge.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Only two islands remained now - the western islands of Kaua'i and Ni'ihau.   From his capital at Honolulu, he constructed a massive warship and attempted his first invasion of Kaua'i in 1796.  A rebellion on the Big Island, led by his brother, forced him to return and reassign his forces.  Not easily foiled, he tried again to take Kaua'i in 1803, but this time a deadly disease broke out among his men.  Tired of his setbacks, Kamehameha then constructed the largest armada in Hawaiian history, filled with European schooners, massive war canoes, and deadly cannon.  The chief of Kaua'i, Kaumuali'i, viewed the approaching armada with perhaps a twinge of trepidation, and decided he'd have better luck of survival with negotiation.  In 1810 Kuamuali'i became a vassal of Kamehameha, who then became the sole ruling power in all of Hawai'i.</Text>

			<Text>Not just a conquering war hero, Kamehameha immediately went to work on improving life on the islands and solidifying the unification.  He created a single legal system, established taxes, and opened official trade with Europe and the United States.  Kamehameha also created the basis for Hawai'i's eventual state constitution, the Law of the Splintered Paddle (the Mamalahoe Kanawai). This law had its humble beginnings during one of Kamehameha's early military engagements.  During a raid, Kamehameha caught his foot under a rock and was ambushed by two local fishermen, who were quite fearful of the legendary warrior.  Scared that he would kill them, they smacked him in the head with their canoe paddle, cracking it in half. While he was stunned, they ran and left him for dead.  Twelve years later, the two fishermen were found and brought to justice; at least, they thought they were. Instead, Kamehameha apologized for attacking innocents and gave the two men gifts of land, proclaiming that all noncombatants would be protected during war from here out. His Splintered Paddle law has since influenced many later humanitarian laws of war around the world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During his reign, he also managed to keep Hawai'i an independent nation while all other Polynesian islands were swallowed by hungry colonial powers.  This legacy of independence earned him the nickname, the "Napoleon of the Pacific".</Text>

Throughout the centuries, however, it has remained the most important Slavic cultural center, playing a pivotal role in the development of the medieval East Slavic civilization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Located on the Dnieper trade route between Constantinople and Scandinavia, Kiev came under the control of local Varangian (Viking) nobility and became the nucleus of the state of Rus. During the 1000s, it reached its ascendancy, a cultural hub with over 400 churches, eight markets, docks and a caravansary, and magnificent homes. With the founding of the Kiev-Mogilyanskaya Academy in 1632, the city became the center of Ukrainian learning and scholarship. But as the capital of Kievan Rus, the city was repeatedly sacked and occupied.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1667 the city became part of the Russian Empire; Kiev remained an ecclesiastical and cultural center, but its political and economic influence was marginalized. Kiev experienced growing "Russification" in the 1800s, as a result of Russian migration, educational policies, and industrialization. However, enthusiasts among ethnic Ukrainian nobles, military officers and merchants kept the native culture alive in Kiev, often through clandestine activities such as book-printing, amateur theater, private soirees, folk festivals and the like.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Forcefully incorporated into the Soviet Union, the city weathered all manner of troubles: the famine of 1932-1933 devastated the lower classes, Stalin's 1937-1938 purges almost obliterated the city's intelligensia, and the 1941-1943 Nazi invasion brought death and destruction. But Kiev survived, and in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union an independent Ukraine was proclaimed in 1991, with resurgent Kiev as its capital and cultural heart.</Text>

Over the course of several thousand years, primitive communities would form, primarily as these gatherers became more adept at hunting. Of the numerous early communities found throughout the peninsula, one in particular would rise to prominence and become the foundation for all of the Korean kingdoms to come - "Ko Choson," also known as "Old Choson."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Old Choson was founded in approximately 2000 BC by the legendary figure Tan'gun Wanggom, whose father is said to have descended from the heavens.

However, diplomatic relations would prove to be the undoing of the Koguryo, as its southernmost rival, Silla, negotiated an alliance with the Tang Dynasty of China.

The "bone-rank system," a sort of hereditary segregation based on a person's blood ties to the king, had maintained the balance of power between the king and the aristocratic nobility for some time. However, this system would ultimately contribute to the downfall of the Silla, as the nobility they desperately relied on for taxation and management grew tired of the caste system that limited their role in governance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the end, continuous internal strife would lead to the kingdom's submission to the emerging Koryo Dynasty by 935.

			<Text>The Choson Dynasty, widely regarded as the most notable kingdom in Korea's history, was founded by the rebellious Koryo Commander Yi Song-gye in 1392. Ordered to invade the neighboring Chinese province of Liaotung (a pre-emptive strike against the Chinese Ming Dynasty), Yi instead seized the opportunity to control Korea himself, leading his army into the Koryo capital and dethroning the king in a military coup. Forming his own dynasty and renaming himself King Taejo of Choson, named for the ancient Choson kingdom, Taejo would create the first unified Korean dynasty in the country's history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most revered of the Choson leaders, King Sejong the Great, ruled from 1418 until his death in 1450. Sejong's policies paved the way for vast strides in the arts and sciences during his reign, including the publication of the Korean written language, "Hangul." It was also during this period that Korean Confucianism, its roots established during the preceding Koryo dynasty, would take hold over Korea. Neo-Confucianism, known as "Seongnihak," would become the primary school of thought for scholars across the peninsula. These Confucian values, emphasizing morality and self-improvement, became the basis for many of the values held sacred by Korean society today.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Choson Dynasty would be ruled by 27 distinct monarchs during its 500-year rule, ending in 1897. During the waning years of the dynasty, Korea underwent a period of isolationism, limiting contact with the surrounding nations in an effort to blunt outside influence. Having long been the subject of Chinese and Japanese influence, many historians believe that it was during this period, when Korea became known as the "Hermit Kingdom," that the first hints of a modern Korean national identity began to take shape.</Text>

			<Text>The Korean War, the great conflict that divided the Korean Peninsula as it stands today, arose from the vacuum of power following Japan's defeat in World War II. The 38th Parallel, a dividing line agreed upon by the United States and the Soviet Union, was expected to mark a temporary administrative split between the countries. In 1948, North Korea would form a communist government led by Kim II-Sung, while South Korea elected its first president, Syngman Rhee, via national elections. Both leaders insisted the Korean people should be united under one rule, but each expected the unification to occur under their own political system.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In June of 1950, North Korea invaded the South, aided by Soviet military equipment from World War II. Shortly thereafter, the United Nations issued a resolution condemning the invasion and recommending military intervention by its member states. At the time, the United States considered the spread of Communism to be a direct result of Soviet influence, and responded as the primary military force aiding South Korea.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although North Korea captured much of the southern territory early in the war, the arrival of American forces under the leadership of General MacArthur soon countered those gains. Eventually regaining South Korea's territory up to the 38th Parallel, the American and South Korean forces would fight the North to an eventual stalemate.  Negotiations for an armistice, which would serve to end the fighting - but not officially end the war - began in 1951 and would continue for several years. The armistice agreement was finally signed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North) and the Republic of Korea (South) under the guidance of the United Nations in 1953.</Text>

Armed with up to two dozen cannons and other small projectile weapons, the Turtle Ship was a dangerous foe for the unprepared navies of Korea's enemies.</Text>

			<Text>Founded in 1914 AD as Belotsarsk by Tsarist Russia to serve as the capital of its Tuva Republic, Kyzyl lies on the confluence of two tributaries of the Yenisei River in the heart of Asia. In fact, the town claims to be built on the exact geographical center of Asia. Historically, the region was controlled by the Mongols until 1757 AD, when it was brought under Manchu rule until 1911. During the 1911 Chinese rebellion, Tsarist Russia proclaimed Tuva a protectorate, a claim China was in no position to challenge. Following the Russian Revolution, the city was occupied at times by both the White and Red armies; after a brief two years under Chinese control again, in August 1921 the local Bolsheviks established a Communist republic, with the city renamed Kyzyl (Turkic for "red") as its capital. The Soviet Union annexed Kyzyl, along with Tuva, outright in 1944.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Until the Russian Federation was formed in 1992 AD, Kyzyl was largely isolated from the world. This 50-year enforced isolation helped preserve the Turkic-Mongolian culture found nowhere else that characterized the town. Khuresh, a Tuvan form of wrestling, is extremely popular, and an annual competition is held in Kyzyl. Turkic music, notably Tuvan throat singing, is celebrated each year at the Naadym festival. Since the Soviet collapse, a concerted effort to preserve the region's rich oral tradition of epics, poems, riddles and tongue-twisters has been promoted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since 1992 the Tuvan Democratic Movement has sought to provide jobs and housing to the nomadic peoples of the republic, as well as promote the Tuvan language and crafts. Following a wave of attacks on Kyzyl's sizeable Russian population, which resulted in 88 deaths, many Russians relocated to other Federation cities. Kyzyl, although being promoted as a tourist venue, remains remote and difficult to reach.</Text>

			<Text>The ancient Olmec settlement of La Venta, found in central Mexico, is thought by archeologists to have been an important cultural center that also contributed greatly to trade in the region. The structures of La Venta are unique in that the surrounding region had no stone available for construction, leaving the Olmec to build everything from clay and fill dirt. Although large portions of the site have been lost to present-day construction, what has been excavated indicates that La Venta held ceremonial significance for the Olmec. Numerous monuments and sculptures adorn the complex, with burial tombs and altars having also been discovered. Of the iconic "Colossal Heads" carved by the Olmec, La Venta features four of the most famous. Weighing several tons each, archeologists can only theorize as to how the Olmec managed to acquire the stone for these massive carvings. Unfortunately, due to ongoing construction taking place in the area, it appears unlikely that further excavations will take place at La Venta in the near future.</Text>

There, in a port that dominated the Straits of Malacca, he founded the Malay kingdom, which soon extended its authority over the whole of the peninsula and beyond. The successor Sultanate of Malacca soon became a vital layover for Chinese, Arab and European traders to replenish their food and water supplies. Malay rule ended in 1511 when Afonso de Albuquerque seized the city for Portugal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over the next century, Malacca became the most important trading port in Southeast Asia, with the Portuguese constructing extensive docks and warehouses to export sugar and rice. Port expansion continued under the Dutch East Indies Company, who captured and fortified the city in 1641 AD. British and Dutch rivalry for control of the strategic straits was settled in favor of the English by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, and Malacca became one of the original "Strait Settlements" in the British Empire. Heavy silting of the harbor estuary, combined with the growth of Singapore, led to Malacca's decline as a commercial center.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the dissolution of the crown colony following Japanese occupation during World War II, Malacca became part of the independent Malayan Union in 1957 AD, which evolved into the modern nation of Malaysia. Prior to the war, the surrounding region had seen the development of rubber as a commercial crop; after the war, rubber became Malacca's primary export, making the city again a major port. Dredging and the construction of seawalls has made the city accessible to deep-draft ocean-going freighters and container ships, and the building of a railroad and modern highways into the city has made it an important cargo terminus in the region once more.</Text>

While their true origin is shrouded in mystery, numerous theories exist as to the early development of Maya civilization. According to archaeological records, the first distinctly Maya settlements were established around 2000 BC. Growing from pre-agricultural communities into vast urban centers, the Maya city-states came to rely on sophisticated farming techniques for both sustenance and trade.

			<Text>Of the many noteworthy aspects of the Maya culture, their calendar system has grown to become the most notorious of their advancements, mainly due to enduring theories about its true purpose. An impressively complex system, the Long Count calendar was one of three used by the Maya, the others being the Haab and the Tzolkin.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Source of the 2012 doomsday predictions, the Long Count calendar was used by the Maya as a historical record of time since the creation of the human world. By this calendar, civilization began on August 11th, 3114 BC, and, as selectively interpreted by those who choose to believe in our impending doom, ends on December 21st, 2012. These doomsayers believe that the Maya foretold the end of the world through the calendar, but most researchers simply interpret it as the end of one cycle and the beginning of another, not a cataclysmic end to the world as we know it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Used in conjunction with the Long Count calendar, the lesser-known Haab was a 365-day calendar that approximated a single solar-year, while the Tzolkin calendar followed a 260 day system used to judge harvest and ritual times.</Text>

			<Text>The arrival of the Spanish quickly led to the demise of the remaining northern Maya cities, and although the Maya people still exist today in Mexico and other parts of Central and South America, much of their culture and history was lost during the conquest of the Conquistadores. Beginning in the early 1500s, the Spanish sent expeditions into the Yucatan Peninsula in hopes of establishing a permanent settlement. However, the decentralized nature of the Maya city-states allowed for independent resistance to the Spanish incursions, and it would take the Spanish nearly 200 years to fully subdue the Maya people throughout the area.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the subjugation of the Maya, there were various attempts to convert the populace to Roman Catholicism by the Spanish. Of these efforts, the most notorious were those undertaken by Spanish bishop Diego de Landa, who served the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatan. De Landa is said to have held an inquisition in the small settlement of Mani, where he burned Maya idols as well as rare written codices, in an attempt to root out the native religion. Although his actions are widely viewed with disdain, De Landa is noted by some historians for keeping his own detailed records of the Maya religion and language as he observed it firsthand traveling among them.</Text>

			<Text>Various theories exist as to the origin of the Maya people, and it's only within the last 50 years that archaeologists studying Mesoamerica have managed to piece together a timeline of their early civilization. Breakthroughs in deciphering the Mayan script during the 1960s and 70s led to a revival in the study of Maya history, which had previously been mired in conjecture due to the lack of written records.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maya civilization is categorized into several distinct cycles, the Pre-Classic, Classic, and Post-Classic periods. Beginning in the Pre-Classic period, the first settlements are thought to have formed between 2000-1500 BC, when the earliest Maya began to transition from a strictly hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a more community-focused agricultural subsistence. Over time these early communities would evolve into an increasingly complex society, not only implementing advanced agricultural practices and trade networks, but also creating grand works of art and architecture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The height of Maya civilization occurred from roughly 250 AD to 900 AD, during a time known as the Classic period. During the Classic period, the Maya developed some of their best known hallmarks, moving towards large independent city-states, each with vast urban centers teeming with monuments to their gods and kings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Post-Classic period began with the decline of major urban centers throughout the southern Maya territory, an unexplained collapse that led to the complete abandonment of some of their greatest cities. However, many of the northern settlements continued to grow and prosper well into the new millennium.</Text>

			<Text>Although the immense cities of the Maya were united by a shared culture, they were also fiercely independent, invariably going to war with one another over territory, trade, and political disputes. Despite this independence, all of the great Maya cities shared a role in influencing their culture as a whole, as each contributed the unique characteristics that defined them as individuals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Believed to be the longest inhabited settlement found anywhere in the Americas, Kaminaljuyu was home to a large Maya population from roughly 1500 BC until about 1200 AD. Dozens of archaeological excavations at the site over the past century have revealed that the city may have been the primary producer of obsidian and jade in the region, and the remnants of more than 100 mounds and ancient structures have been discovered. Unfortunately, commercial construction and development of the surrounding area during the 19th and 20th centuries has all but destroyed the remains of this once great city, leaving only fragments behind.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El Mirador, flourishing from roughly 600 BC until 100 AD, was another great city of the Maya. A settlement of significant size, El Mirador is noted for its numerous elevated roadways, known to the Maya as the "Sacbe." Used to connect structures within the settlement complex as well as distant trade centers, the sacbe were a crucial mechanism in establishing the Maya trade networks. Similar to modern causeways that are raised over stretches of unstable land, the sacbe covered vast expanses, the longest connecting the ancient city of Coba with the smaller settlement of Yaxuna some 60 miles (96 km) away.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps the best known of the Classic Maya cities, Tikal, served as capital of the powerful Tikal state, an ambitious and aggressive state that often initiated fierce battles against its neighboring rivals. Tikal is thought to have been occupied for nearly 2,000 years, and was home to some 100,000 people at its peak. One of the lesser known innovations found at Tikal, the "Aguada," was an ingenious system of water reservoirs, designed to harvest and collect rain water funneled from the plaster walls of the city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chitzen Itza was one of the last surviving Mayan settlements, and as such it's also one of the best preserved of their cities. With extensive constructions covering an area over 2.5 sq. miles (6.5 sq. km), Chitzen Itza features prominent examples of nearly every form of Maya architecture including massive step pyramids, multiple ball courts, and ornately-decorated temples.</Text>

Marking the beginning of the Post-Classic period, it wasn't until after the collapse that the famous city of Chitzen Itza first rose to prominence. Chitzen Itza survived for several hundred years before falling into a ruinous civil war with the neighboring Mayapan in the 1300s.

			<Text>Although the Maya were never unified as a single empire, instead living in city-states similar to the ancient Greeks, each independent state still followed a similar class structure. Beginning around the 3rd century BC, the Maya were ruled by hereditary succession, unless a suitable heir was unavailable. The king was joined by his family and other high ranking citizens to form the upper class of nobility. Beneath the nobles, the priestly class of shamans made up the next tier, guiding the Maya kings and leading the people through the many rituals and ceremonial rites undertaken throughout the year. Beyond these ruling classes, the majority of the Maya were simply the "common folk"-farmers, craftsmen, and laborers. Lower still, the underclass consisted primarily of slaves, who were prisoners of war and criminals.</Text>

			<Text>While working with limited access to fresh groundwater, the Maya utilized a number of agricultural techniques that allowed them to take full benefit of the rich soil within their domain. The "Milpa" system of crop rotation, known to have been used by a variety of Mesoamerican societies, was particularly effective for the Maya. A type of slash-and-burn farming, the Milpa system involved intercropping multiple species of vegetation together followed by periods where the fields were left fallow, or unseeded. Typically this rotation period allowed for two or three years of planting, followed by six to eight years without use. The crops of the Maya farmers were primarily corn, squash, and beans, known collectively as "The Three Sisters."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Maya were not only able farmers, but also skilled hunters and fishermen. Relying on a number of tools and weapons, the Maya primarily hunted deer, rabbit, and the "peccary," a pig-like creature found in the rainforest. The Maya also utilized an innovative spear-throwing device, the Atlatl, which they used for both hunting and warfare. Using a wooden shaft with a cupped end, the spear (or dart) would be laid along its length, and, using the thrower's natural motion, the spear would be propelled at a much higher rate of speed due to the additional extension provided by the device. Spears thrown from the Atlatl are said to be capable of reaching speeds over 100 mph (160 km/h), which allowed the Maya greater confidence in stalking larger, faster prey.</Text>

			<Text>Like other polytheistic societies throughout the world, the Maya worshipped a vast pantheon of gods, led by the creator god Itzamna. Special emphasis was placed on the sky gods, particularly Kinish Ahau, the sun god, and the moon goddess, Ixchel. The Maya also had gods for the weather, their crops, and the various professions in their society. The Maya maize god was of particular importance once the crop became a staple of survival during the later stages of their development.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Throughout the year, the Maya held a number of rituals honoring the gods, based largely on their knowledge of astronomy and the calendar.  Of the cultures that utilized human sacrifice, the Maya were far from the most prolific, but they did partake in bloodletting and sacrifice during their most important rituals. Human sacrifices were thought to have promoted fertility, and the Mayas were known to sacrifice humans by throwing them into freshwater sinkholes, honoring the rain god, Chaac. The famous Sacred Cenote, found at Chitzen Itza, was the site of numerous human sacrifices during the Classic period of Maya history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Along with many other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya played a ritualistic ballgame where they attempted to knock a solid rubber ball (weighing 5-10 lbs) through a vertically mounted hoop using their hips. The game was played both recreationally and at ceremonial events, and was also used as a competitive means of settling territorial disputes, potentially resulting in the deaths of the losing team.</Text>

			<Text>At the height of their civilization, the Maya created many great works of art featuring intricate carvings and reliefs in stone and jade, as the artisans of each city incorporated unique regional characteristics into their work. The Maya also developed a range of pigments and dyes using the available resources of the jungle, most notably the color "Maya Blue," a vivid blue tone made from indigo dye that was later adopted into the works of the European colonists, following the decline of Maya society.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Among Maya architecture, its most recognizable aspect is the step pyramid, dozens of which were constructed during the later stages of their civilization. Just as it sounds, the step pyramid consisted of layers of stone built in stepped levels cresting in a flat peak where religious ceremonies often took place. It is thought that the Mesoamerican step pyramids were built upon existing burial mounds or earlier temples, and may have been rebuilt over time based on calendar cycles. The most prominent example of the Maya step-pyramid is found at the site of Chichen Itza in the Yucatan Peninsula, a well-preserved example under the stewardship of the Mexican government.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Maya writing system, made up of a script often referred to as glyphs or hieroglyphs because of its similarity to the ancient Egyptian writing system. Found inscribed on works throughout their territory and gradually deciphered over the past century, the Maya used this script to memorialize many aspects of their culture. Although there is evidence that Maya scribes created bound volumes using bark and animal skin, much of this work was destroyed during the colonial incursions of the Spanish in the 16th century, as it was thought to be as heretical.</Text>

			<Text>Situated on a low plateau in northwestern Angola, M'banza-Kongo was home to the Manikongo, absolute ruler of the Kingdom of Kongo, founded c. 1390 AD. At its peak, the Bantu warriors of M'banza-Kongo controlled a territory that reached from Africa's mid-Atlantic coast to the Kwango River, and from Point Noire in the north to the Loje River in the south. The city supported itself through taxes, forced labor, and royal levies; at times, to finance his military, the Manikongo traded slaves, copper and ivory with the Europeans on the coast. It was also supported by exhorting tribute from neighboring cities and kingdoms, making M'banza-Kongo one of the wealthiest African cities in the 1500s.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1568 AD, the king was compelled to allow the Portuguese to establish a colony in the Luanda province. From this base the Portuguese would gradually gain control over most of the territory surrounding M'banza-Kongo, leading to increased tension. At the Battle of Ambuila in 1665, a force of Portuguese musketeers and light cannon decisively defeated the Manikongo's army; casualties among the native warriors were in excess of 5000, including the king, effectively ending M'banza-Kongo's military supremacy in the region. The battle is generally regarded as the decisive turning point in the city's history, for it was sacked several times during the civil wars that followed the king's death, and it was largely abandoned by 1678.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]M'banza-Kongo was re-occupied by the Portuguese-supported native Christian prophet Beatriz Kimpa Vita and her followers in 1705 AD and restored as Kongo's capital in 1709. Although now effectively a vassal of Portugal, the kingdom continued to exist for another 150 years, until divided between Portugal, Belgium and France at the Conference of Berlin in 1884.

It is distinguished from other Australian cities in that it is the only one founded by private enterprise rather than the crown. Melbourne was incorporated as a city in 1847, but its main growth came in the 1850s following discovery of gold at nearby Bendigo and Ballarat. The town served as the principle port and supply hub for the ensuing gold rush, and its population increased from 25 to 40 thousand in a few months.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The economic boom peaked in the 1880s, by which time Melbourne was considered the richest city in the world and the largest in the British Empire after London. As a result of the boom, commercial buildings and banks, terrace apartments and palatial mansions sprang up across the city. But the gold boom ended in 1891 AD, bringing bankruptcy to many businesses and economic depression; the financial crisis in Melbourne contributed to the Australian banking panic of 1893.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The city's banking and industry recovered and Melbourne grew slowly through the early part of the 20th Century. At the time of federation, creating the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 AD, Melbourne was important enough to become the seat of government (until transferred to the new capital at Canberra in 1927). In the aftermath of World War II, the city's economic influence was strengthened even more by the influx of immigrants, primarily from southern Europe, bringing new businesses and industries. Major transportation and housing projects marked the 1970s through 1990s; recent substantial international investment has given the city a diversified economy particularly strong in banking and finance, manufacturing, shipping, research, information technology and tourism.</Text>

			<Text>Founded in the 4th century BC by the Celtic Insubres people, the city of Milan in northern Italy grew over time to become one of the greatest cultural centers of the Italian Renaissance period.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After being conquered by the Romans in approximately 222 BC, Milan later became one of the three capitals of the Roman Empire during the Tetrarchy of Emperor Diocletian. Passing through the hands of a number of kings and empires following Rome's decline, Milan's prosperity continued to climb as the city became an increasingly important bastion in northern Italy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of the many notable aspects of Milan's history, none have a greater renown than the city's cultural contributions to the world. As an integral part of the Italian Renaissance movement, Milan was home to many great artists, who produced some of the greatest works of the era. Perhaps the most famous of Milan's residents was the painter Leonardo Da Vinci, who spent much of his life working and studying in the city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the present day, Milan is still recognized as one of the world's leading cultural centers, with much of the current focus being on fashion and modern design.  Milan is also one of Italy's most important commercial business centers, as much of the country's transportation infrastructure leads through the city. Numerous multinational corporations also have offices in Milan, with industries ranging from telecommunications to manufacturing.</Text>

			<Text>According to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Mogadishu was already a major maritime center in the 1st Century AD when Roman merchants began trading from Egyptian ports along the Red Sea coast. With the settlement of Muslim traders in the Somali city around 900 AD, trade routes were expanded to distant realms such as China, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. By the time the Moroccan explorer and author ibn-Batuta arrived in 1331, Mogadishu was at the zenith of its prosperity, the pre-eminent city on the Horn of Africa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The wealth of Mogadishu became the stuff of legend in Europe, supported by the observations of travelers. Vasco de Gama, who stopped in the city in the 15th Century, noted that it was well defended and well built, with houses of four or five stories, large palaces in the center, and many mosques. The following century the Portuguese traveler Duarte Barbosa wrote of hundreds of ships from distant lands that sailed into its harbor with cargos of cloth and spices which they bartered for gold, wax and ivory. Barbosa also described Mogadishu as the center of a thriving weaving industry that produced a light-weight fabric highly valued in Egypt and Syria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Spurred by greed, European powers sought to incorporate the city into their colonial empires; the Portuguese tried unsuccesfully and later the British East India Company briefly established control. In 1892 AD the Zanzibar sultan leased Mogadishu to Italy, which made it the capital of Italian Somalia in 1905. In 1960 Somalia achieved its independence peacefully. But the democracy collapsed in the course of the 1991 civil war. Since 1994, when the United Nations withdrew its peacekeeping force, Mogadishu has been torn by near constant fighting between rival militias. In such chaos, the once thriving port has fallen into disrepair and disuse.</Text>

			<Text>Although the founding of Mombasa is shrouded in conflicting historical records, it is believed the city, now the second largest in Kenya, was settled sometime around the 10th century AD. By the Middle Ages, Mombasa had grown into a flourishing city with an economy primarily based on the export of Ivory. Mombasa was also known for its vast network of plantations producing coconuts, cashews, and millet, which were then shipped out along the trade routes crossing the Indian Ocean. Mombasa's port, known as the Kilindini Harbor, is the only international seaport in Kenya, which has allowed the city to become a major center of commerce and trade for the entire nation. In the present day, Mombasa's largest exports continue to be agricultural in nature, particularly coffee, tea, and grain.</Text>

Riding on their small but hearty steppe ponies, the lightly-armed and armored Mongols could cover an astonishing amount of territory in a day, far outpacing any infantry or even the heavier European cavalry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In battle the Mongol Keshiks would shoot from horseback with deadly accuracy, disrupting and demoralizing the enemy formations.

He created a code of laws called the Yassa, which governed everyone in the Empire, nobleman and commoner alike.  The Yassa imposed harsh penalties on anyone caught not obeying the law (usually death), religious freedom was guaranteed to any and all, all forms of vandalizing was forbidden, and government officials were selected based on merit - not blood.  Despite its huge size and disparate groupings of people, the Mongolian Empire was incredibly well-run and one of the safest places on earth, if you followed the rules.

Whatever the truth of that statement, today Morocco is one of the most progressive of Muslim states, maintains close economic and cultural ties with the liberal Western nations, yet retains its distinctive cultural identity. Although the area comprising Morocco has been inhabited since antiquity - with settlements founded by Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans and Vandals - the country was first unified following the Berber Revolt (739-743 AD) which overthrew Arab rule. Under successive Islamic caliphates, Morocco dominated the vast Maghreb, a region of Northwest Africa that encompasses the Atlas and Rif mountain ranges, western Sahara, and southern Mediterranean coast. In 1554 AD, the Saadi sultan Mohammed ash-Sheikh claimed sovereignty over the whole of Morocco. Morocco turned back various invasions and incursions by the Europeans and Ottoman Turks during the following century, making it the only Arab country never to experience Ottoman dominance. The 17th Century saw the Saadi supplanted by the Alaouite dynasty, which continues to rule as a constitutional monarchy. Despite a fifty-year period as a French and Spanish protectorate, Morocco gained its independence again in 1956 AD.</Text>

The western Saharan desert covers most of the southeast portion of the country. The Maghreb is marked by a Mediterranean climate in the north between the Atlas Mountains and the coast and the arid Sahara to the south. Thus, the northern areas of Morocco enjoy cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers, while the Sahara is characterized by extreme heat and a lack of precipitation. The coastal plains have been heavily cultivated since the earliest arrival of human beings in the region. Where the Rif Mountains tend to be barren, covered with grasses and moss, the higher Atlas Mountains were thick with oak, juniper, and cedar forests and many species of game through most of recorded history. By contrast, the Sahara contains only sand dunes and rocky outcrops, broken by the occasional oasis. While other peoples colonized along the rich coastlines, it was the harsh Rif and Atlas mountains that gave rise to the native Berber peoples.</Text>

			<Text>The land that comprises Morocco has been home to humans for hundreds of millennia; the bones of early Homo sapiens uncovered at Jebel Irhoud date to 160 thousand years ago. A Neolithic culture - which would give rise to the Berbers - arose between 6000 BC and 3000 BC in the Maghreb, which was less arid than currently. The Berber language, along with agricultural settlements, came into being in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains and along the Atlantic coast around 2000 BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Phoenician traders, exploring the western Mediterranean c. 1200 BC, established settlements along the coast to mine salt and minerals in what is now Morocco. Carthage, expanding westward from its core territories in Tunisia, developed relations with several Berber kingdoms by the 5th Century BC. Although Carthage extended its hegemony along most of the North African Mediterranean coast, a powerful Berber kingdom - Mauretania - remained independent. Following the Punic wars, Roman rule replaced Carthaginian and most of the Berber kingdoms, including Mauretania, became Roman vassals. In turn, the decline of Rome in the west brought the Vandals across the straits from Spain in the 5th Century AD.

			<Text>The Arabs overran the Maghreb in the latter half of the 7th Century, converting the indigenous Berber population to Islam. While local governors were appointed to administer the region, in general the Arab rulers considered the Berbers as little more than a troublesome, conquered people, imposing high taxes and demands for tribute on the tribes. In 740 AD, the Berbers revolted. Begun among the tribes of western Morocco, the rebellion spread across the Maghreb liked wildfire but petered out before the walls of the Arabic fortress city of Kairouan. Nonetheless, the Berbers had established their independence from the Arabs, and neither the Umayyad nor their Abbasid successors were able to re-establish authority over Islam's "wild west" again. Morocco was marked by dozens of small, autonomous Berber kingdoms; meanwhile, the Berbers in these separate kingdoms shaped Islam to their own tastes, ranging from radical Islamic sects to a synthesis of other faiths with Islam.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Morocco quickly became the haven for refugees, radicals, rebels and adventurers from the eastern Arabian caliphate. One of these, Idris ibn Abdallah, made common cause with the Awraba Berbers, to conquer a number of other tribes and found the Idrisid dynasty in 788 AD. His son, Idris II, built a new capital in Fes and Morocco grew into a major power and center of Islamic scholarship.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This "golden age" ended in the early 900s when another group of religious refugees arrived from the east. The Fatimids had seized power in what is now Tunisia, and proceeded to invade Morocco, conquering both the Idrisids and the Sijilmassa kingdom to the south. But the invaders found it impossible to enforce their rule on the Berber tribesmen. The Maghreb fell into chaos, fought over by the Fatimid generals, Idrisid loyalists, Umayyad adventurers, tribal chieftains, and militant religious prophets. In 965 AD the Fatimid caliph al-Muizz brought a massive army into Morocco to impose order, which lasted only until the Fatimids turned their attention to Egypt and their new capital in Cairo.</Text>

			<Text>The rule of the Saadi dynasty, an Arabic family which claimed direct descent from Mohammed, began in 1554 AD when Mohammed ash-Sheikh defeated the Wattasids and their Berber allies at the Battle of Talda. The Saadi had already captured the Wattasid capital of Fes, and when the last Wattasid ruler died at Talda ash-Sheikh declared himself undisputed sultan of Morocco. His reign was cut short, however, when the Ottomans had him assassinated in 1557 and invaded the country the following year. The Ottoman army was defeated by a coalition of Saadi, Berber and Spanish forces, insuring that the Saadi family would retain control of the throne.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The next in line of succession, Abdallah al-Ghalib (1557-1574 AD), spent his rule consolidating his sovereignty over the unallied Berber tribes, and playing the Spanish off against the Ottomans. Upon his death, a power struggle between his sons ended with the fifth, the extremely able Ahmad al-Mansur, ascending the throne. Born of a Berber mother, he enjoyed unparalleled support among the Berbers and, being a devout Moslem, among the Arabs as well.

			<Text>During the period of unrest following the death of al-Mansur, the Alouite family was able to unite several of the Berber and Bedouin tribes that lived in the area surrounding the oasis at Tafilalt. By 1664, the whole of the Moroccan Sahara and Draa River Valley were under Alouite sovereignty. Two years later, with a small army of tribesmen, Moulay al-Rashid marched into Fes and ended the influence of the zaouia of Dila, a nationalistic Berber movement that controlled much of northern Morocco. In 1669 AD, the last Saadi sultan was overthrown in the fall of Marrakech to al-Rashid, who proclaimed himself sultan of all Morocco.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For 150 years, Morocco thrived under Alouite rule, spurred by modernization, administrative reform, religious tolerance and increasing trade with Europe and the United States. But when sultan Moulay abd al-Rahman ibn Hisham (1822-1859) supported the Algerian independence movement of abn al-Qadir, he was decisively defeated by French forces in 1844. His successors, Muhammed IV and Hassan I, were increasingly drawn into conflict with the European powers. Although the independence of Morocco was supposedly guaranteed by the Conference of Madrid (1880), the French repeatedly interfered in its internal affairs. German efforts to counter French influence in the Maghreb resulted in the First (1905-1906) and Second (1911) Moroccan Crises. In 1912, the Alouite sultans were forced to recognize a French Protectorate of Morocco in the Treaty of Fes in December 1912. Around the same date, the Rif region of northern Morocco was placed under the "protection" of Spain.</Text>

			<Text>Technically, the protectorates did not deprive Morocco of its status as a sovereign state; the Alouite sultans "reigned but did not rule." In establishing their administration of the country, France had lengthy experience gained by their conquest of Algeria and protectorate over Tunisia. However, there were some crucial differences. For one, the Moroccan protectorate was established less than two years before the outbreak of World War I, which brought new concerns over the morality and challenges of colonial rule. Too, the new French administrators rejected the previous policy of assimilation of the native people; instead, they opted to use urban planning and education to prevent cultural mixing. Finally, Morocco had a thousand-year tradition of independence, based on the fierce individuality of its Berber tribesmen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The French governors of Morocco allied themselves politically with the tens of thousands of French colons (colonists) that flooded in to buy vast tracts of rich agricultural land. In France itself, political factions supported the most draconian of measures to increase French control. As pacification of the Berbers and nationalists proceeded slowly, the French government sought to force economic development, including the exploitation of Morocco's rich mineral deposits, the creation of a modern transportation system, and investment in a modern agricultural industry aimed to feed the French markets.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Spanish protectorate was more benign, maintaining the local laws and the authority of local rulers. The fact that the Rif had many enclaves of Sephardic Jews, descendants of refugees from Spain and Portugal in the 1490s, that had profited from commerce between Africa and Iberia over the centuries certainly made Spanish rule more comfortable in terms of language and culture. Nor did the Spanish government encourage their citizens to immigrate to Morocco, although it did encourage investment in Moroccan businesses. In general, with the exception of the period of the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s, Spanish Morocco was peaceful and profitable for all concerned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following years of unrest, urban riots and tribal uprisings, in 1953 the French exiled the beloved Moroccan sultan Mohammed V and replaced him with Mohammed ben Aarafa, whose claim to the throne was universally viewed as illegitimate. Three years later, faced with unified Moroccan resistance and a civil war raging in Algeria, France agreed to negotiate a return to independence for the country. Mohammed V successfully negotiated the gradual restoration of Moroccan sovereignty, agreeing - among other things - to the establishment of a constitutional monarch and a two-chamber parliament to govern. The succeeding Alouite kings continued to forge ever-closer ties with the western democracies, making modern Morocco one of the most stable and liberal of the Muslim nations, with a vibrant culture and economy.</Text>

			<Text>Nebuchadnezzar (which is sometimes spelled "Nebuchadrezzar") was the oldest son of Nabopolassar, the founder of the Chaldean empire, who had done much to make Babylon into an imperial power. He served under his father in several military campaigns, and in 606 BC he commanded an army which destroyed an Egyptian army at Carchemish, securing for Babylon the control of Syria.</Text>

He resumed campaigning shortly thereafter, when he conquered a number of smaller states including Judah. He continued his conquests until 600, when, possibly over-extended, he lost badly to an Egyptian army. Taking advantage of Babylon's disarray, Judah and several other subject states revolted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It took Nebuchadnezzar some two years to regroup and rebuild his armies, but by 598 he was on the march again, and in 597 he occupied Jerusalem, deposing the Judaian king Jehoiachin and transporting him and other prominent citizens to captivity in Babylon (most likely as hostages against further Jewish rebellions). He continued his expansionist military campaigns for the rest of his reign, clashing more or less successfully with the other powers in the Eastern Mediterranean, Asia Minor and the Middle East.</Text>

Nebuchadnezzar II died in Babylon in 562 BC. He is remembered as a successful military leader who increased the size of his empire and who strengthened and improved the capital city of Babylon, and who treated his subject people well.

			<Text>The Kingdom of the Netherlands, often referred to simply as "Holland," has, under the influence of many ambitious empires, grown from a minor province of northern Europe into one of the world's premier trade centers.  Beginning with the conquests of the Romans, the later rise of the Franks, and eventually the Holy Roman Empire, the Netherlands became a frequent target of expanding European kingdoms. However, none would leave a greater mark than the Spanish Habsburgs, whose persecution of Dutch Protestants under King Philip contributed directly to the outbreak of the Eighty Years' War. Pitting the Dutch citizenry against their Spanish masters in a near-century long conflict for independence, once free of Spanish rule, the people of the Netherlands worked tirelessly to establish their own national identity. As the new republic grew to become a leading economic power, many great cultural and scientific figures rose from the newly formed nation.</Text>

			<Text>Following the Eighty Years' War and the creation of the Dutch Republic in the north, the Netherlands quickly became the dominant center of trade in Europe. Led by the Dutch East India Company, the world's first multinational corporation, Dutch traders established new commercial routes and settled colonies across the globe. This period that came to be known as the "Dutch Golden Age" also saw the swift ascension of Dutch scientific advancements, military innovation, and a flourishing culture of art and music within the Netherlands.</Text>

			<Text>As England grew increasingly concerned over Dutch trade with the English, French, and Spanish colonies, hampering British trade efforts and profitability, a series of acts passed by the British Parliament in 1651 sought to control the extent of Dutch shipping. Known as the Navigation Acts, these regulations sought to restrict Dutch access to the English ports. These efforts by England to control the seas led directly to a series of conflicts known as the Anglo-Dutch Wars, fought throughout the 17th century. Over the course of the next 100 years and well into the mid-1700s, Dutch power in both political circles and world trade was greatly reduced as a result of numerous naval battles that reduced the size and power of the Dutch fleet.</Text>

			<Text>During the Napoleonic Wars, the Netherlands as a whole were seized by the French in 1795, leading to the formation of the short-lived Batavian Republic, a satellite of the French Republic. With the signing of the Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1814, formally declaring the end to Napoleon's conquests of Europe, the Dutch people were once again able to claim their independence by forming the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Shortly thereafter, Belgium, which had still been considered part of the Netherlands up until this time, broke off to form an independent nation of its own in 1830.</Text>

			<Text>Since first establishing themselves as a sovereign nation, the Dutch continually made efforts to maintain a policy of strict neutrality whenever possible. As such, the Netherlands remained neutral throughout the great conflict that was World War I, committing no arms to the fight but still maintaining economic ties with the belligerents of both sides.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During World War II, the Dutch again declared their neutrality at the outbreak of hostilities. However, this time Germany would not allow the valuable Dutch territory to remain unaligned. Invading in 1940, the Nazis faced initial resistance from the Dutch military, but the Netherlands were ultimately overrun and occupied by the Third Reich. During the German occupation, the Dutch government fled the country and operated in exile, leaving the nation under the control of Nazi forces. Although a resistance movement within the Netherlands grew as the Nazi occupation became increasingly unbearable, the Nazis were still successful in killing thousands of Dutch Jews as well as Jewish exiles from Germany, including Anne Frank, whose diary has become a widely read chronicle of the Holocaust.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1944, in an effort to seize control of the bridges leading from the Netherlands to Germany over the Rhine and Maas rivers, the Allies launched one of the largest airborne missions in history, known as Operation Market Garden. The allies dropped thousands of paratroopers into the region, but the mission was met with limited success. Allied commanders blamed poor weather and communication issues with hampering the allied push. As a result, the Netherlands remained under the grip of the Nazi regime until the eventual surrender of German forces in the spring of 1945.</Text>

The provinces of the Netherlands in Europe are extremely low in elevation, with much of the territory having been reclaimed from the sea through the extensive use of dykes. Despite a relatively small land area, approximately twice the size of the U.S. state of New Jersey, the Netherlands is home to more than 16 million people.

			<Text>Before the arrival of the Romans during the 1st century BC, the region of the Netherlands was inhabited by a wide range of Germanic tribes. Migrating from the surrounding areas, particularly Scandinavia, these tribes were also the early descendants of the Celts, who traced their origins to nearby Austria and Germany. Of these tribes, the Batavi, who lived on an island along the Rhine River, were among the most powerful and feared. Although the Batavians weren't known to have been particularly successful in trade or craft, their renown in battle alone was enough to secure their dominant position among the surrounding tribes.</Text>

			<Text>The southernmost region of the Netherlands, known to the Romans as the province of Germania Inferior, was occupied during the 1st century AD by the Roman military. As documented by Julius Caesar in his "Commentaries on the Gallic Wars," the tribal Batavi are said to have fought alongside the Romans as mercenaries during their campaigns across Europe. The Batavi eventually revolted against the increasingly restrictive Roman control, which led to their subjugation. Roman forces controlled the area uncontested for nearly 400 years, until the collapse of the empire as a whole.</Text>

			<Text>Although written records of this period are scarce, following the decline of the Roman Empire, the territory the Romans once occupied within the Netherlands was quickly absorbed by the Franks and the Frisians. Although these tribal groups had lived throughout the area for centuries, with the absence of the once powerful Romans, the opportunity for their expansion was now greatly increased. The Empire of the Franks eventually encompassed nearly all of the Netherlands and Germany, except for the Frisian Kingdom situated along the northern coast. Living in such close confines, the Franks and Frisians eventually became bitter rivals, settling their territorial disputes through a series of wars. In 734, the Franks' victory at the Battle of the Boarn marked the dissolution of the Frisian Kingdom and their absorption into the Frankish Empire. The later conquest of Italy and the Frankish expansion under Charlemagne created the foundations of several future kingdoms, including those of France and Germany, under whose dominion the Netherlands fell in the coming centuries.</Text>

			<Text>Following Charlemagne's death in 814, the Frankish Empire was divided into three parts, the Middle, Eastern, and Western Frankish kingdoms. The majority of the Netherlands became part of the Middle Kingdom, under the rule of Lothair I. The division of the once vast empire also led to the creation of the Kingdoms of Germany (which would become the Holy Roman Empire) and France, both of whom battled for influence and territory within the Netherlands.  While much of the region would eventually fall under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire through the 15th Century AD, the Dukes of Burgundy, an offshoot of the French royal family, began to look towards the Netherlands with an eye for acquisition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was also during this period that the first of many terrible floods struck the Netherlands, killing thousands and destroying much of the infrastructure within the country. In 1287, the disastrous St. Lucia's flood struck the Netherlands, killing over 50,000 people and turning a small lake into an inlet of the North Sea that was known as the Zuiderzee. The Zuiderzee was only finally sealed off from the North Sea in the 20th century, reestablishing the freshwater lake as it once was.</Text>

Throughout the 1400s, the French dukes continually acquired more and more territory throughout the Dutch Low Country, via marriage and inheritance, carefully timed purchases, and annexation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Burgundian holdings within the Netherlands were inherited by the House of Habsburg through the marriage of Mary of Burgundy to the Duke of Austria, Maximilian I. Although his inheritance of the Burgundian lands was disputed by the King of France, the land was eventually passed to Mary's son, Phillip I, ensuring the transfer of power to the Habsburgs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1521, the House of Habsburg was divided between the Spanish and Austrian Habsburg family lines, with the Spanish Habsburgs maintaining control of the Netherlands while the Austrians held Germany and the surrounding region as successive Holy Roman Emperors.</Text>

			<Text>During the Protestant Reformation of Europe, wherein the traditional authority of Roman Catholicism came into question, the Protestant movement established a firm foothold within the Netherlands.  The spread of Protestant beliefs within the Netherlands was of great concern to the nation's Catholic rulers, initially Charles V, and, more importantly, the later rule of his son, Philip II of Spain. King Philip's increasingly vicious persecution of the Dutch Protestants would lead to a surge in discontent among the Dutch people in the coming years.</Text>

			<Text>As resentment of Philip's policies spread throughout the Netherlands, the most prominent figure of the Dutch revolt, William of Orange, emerged as a vocal proponent of religious tolerance. William was himself raised as a Protestant, but converted to Catholicism as part of his noble upbringing. Despite his religious views, he firmly believed that all people had the right to practice their own beliefs. As William was a Dutch nobleman, and served Spain as a loyal subject, he was initially hesitant to defy the king. However, when Philip made no attempt to appease the concerns of the Dutch, William's hand was forced.  By 1567, small rebellions were already underway, and by choosing to fund the uprising and turn his back on Philip, William was declared an outlaw by Spain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After William led his army to several victories in open warfare against Spain, in 1581 the Republic of the Seven United Provinces was created in the liberated northern territories. However, these initial successes only marked the beginning of a long conflict known as the Eighty Years' War, during which time the Spanish king remained in control of the southern Dutch territories. William of Orange was assassinated in 1584 by a Catholic follower loyal to king Philip, and the war raged on until 1648, when the Dutch Republic in its entirety was finally freed of Spanish control.</Text>

The city dominates the narrow Strait of Hormuz, the strategic waterway linking the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. Ormus grew immensely rich by being the crucial stage on the slave routes from East Africa into Persia and Arabia. At the zenith of its influence in the 14th Century, it was the most powerful maritime state in the region, with a large commercial fleet and a navy of 500 warships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1505 AD, King Manuel I of Portugal decided to block Muslim trade with India. Afonso de Albuquerque took his ships into the gulf in 1507, captured the island of Hormuz, built a fort there, and claimed the city of Ormus for Portugal. In March 1515 Albuquerque returned with a fleet of 27 vessels, 1500 soldiers with cannons to insure that the city remained under Portuguese rule. The city became known for its licentiousness and guilty pleasures, according to accounts by Portuguese visitors and priests. The luxury and leisure of Ormus is captured in an Arab saying of the time: "If all the world were a golden ring, Ormus would be the jewel in it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although largely bypassed by maritime routes for three centuries after, the discovery of oil in the Persian Gulf and Middle East again gave the city a new role in world trade. In 2011 AD, 35% of the world's seaborne oil shipments passed by the city. The Iranian Revolution that disposed the absolute monarchy in favor of an Islamic fundamentalist republic under the Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979 only heightened the city's strategic significance, as the new government proved hostile to the Western powers.</Text>

His new empire stretched from Ecuador to Chile and became one of the most formidable kingdoms in South America.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While many kingdoms were gained through conquest, Pachacuti also employed a more devious tactic to acquire new regions. First he would send spies out to areas which interested him, gaining intelligence on wealth and military might.  If intrigued, he would invite the leaders of these lands to submit peacefully, extolling the virtues of living under Incan rule.  Many accepted (not wanting to repeat the fate of the Chancas) and sent their children to live in Cusco, where they were educated under Incan law. They were then indoctrinated and married into the Incan nobility before being sent back to rule their original lands, ensuring the expansion of and continued peace in the empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To keep his new land in order, he established four provinces, each controlled by a local governor who ran the day to day affairs. He also created a separate branch of power for both the priesthood and army, forming one of the first systems of checks and balances.  Cusco itself was rebuilt to serve as an Imperial Capital City, and each province had its own sector dedicated in the city.  During this time he also constructed the famed Machu Picchu, believed now to be a mountain estate built for his personal use.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After his death in 1471, Pachacuti's younger son Tupac became the next emperor of the Incan Empire, the elder Amaru passed over for not being a warrior like his father.</Text>

To ensure the continuation of his empire, he displaced hundreds of thousands of people, relocating them about the empire as he saw fit.

			<Text>Panama City, capital of the Republic of Panama, is the Pacific terminus of the Panama Canal on the Gulf of Panama. The word "panama" means "many fish," and the city is built on the site of a large native fishing village existing when the Spanish conquistadors arrived. The port city was founded in 1519 AD by the Spanish governor of Panama on the Pacific side of the isthmus to facilitate the trans-shipment of goods and treasure from the Atlantic. It served as the principle staging point for the conquest of the Incan Empire, and the Incan riches passed through on the way to Spain's treasury.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The city quickly became wealthy from this trade, and was subsequently plundered and burned by the English pirate Sir Henry Morgan. Three years later, the city was rebuilt slightly to the south. Although Panama City itself was thereafter well defended by the Spanish, the 1746 destruction of the Caribbean port at Portobelo dealt a serious blow to the overland trade route. Panama City declined in wealth and prestige, although it returned to prominence again a century later when the Panama Railroad opened and gold seekers bound for California flowed across the isthmus by rail and road. Ships from Panama City carried the flood of peoples and supplies north that the Gold Rush unleashed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After Panama declared its independence from Columbia in 1903, the city was established as the capital. When the Panama Canal was completed in 1914, the city emerged as Central America's hub for international commerce, trade and tourism. Home to over 80 banks, today Panama City is considered the wealthiest city in Latin America. The recent spate of foreign investment in Panamanian shipping and the 2006 referendum to expand the Canal means the city is likely to continue its remarkable economic boom.</Text>

			<Text>Invasion, occupation, partition, rebellion and rebirth - that cycle has characterized the tragic and triumphant history of Poland for the past millennium. Lying between the Baltic Sea to the north and the Carpathian Mountains to the south, the Polish plain served as the gateway for invasions of the heartland of Europe from the east and invasions of the vast tracts of Russia from the west. Poland became a recognizable ethnic and political entity in the mid-10th Century AD under the Piast dynasty of kings; its modern history begins in 966 when the first Piast king, Mieszko I, was converted to Christianity. For hundreds of years afterward, Poland's fortunes waxed and waned at the hands of powerful neighbors and invaders, from the German Teutonic Knights to the Mongol Golden Horde to the Soviet Union's forces. Even in times of national crisis, however, Polish ideals of revolution and independence remained strong. Those ideals, carried abroad by Polish expatriates such as Pulaski and Kosciuszko, informed the American and French revolutions. The Polish constitution of 1791 AD, the oldest in Europe, incorporated those same democratic ideals. Restored as a free nation in 1918 but ravaged by two world wars, few peoples suffered as much in the 20th Century as the Poles. Following a half-century of totalitarian rule as a communist satellite, in the 1980s the Polish movement Solidarity oversaw its transformation into a sovereign state once again. At the beginning of the 21st Century, Poland is a progressive, market-based democracy, an important member of both NATO and the European Union.</Text>

			<Text>A land of striking natural beauty, Poland is a landscape of broad forests (covering roughly 30.5% of the country), great rivers (notably the Vistula and the Oder), and broad plains. Poland lies in the physical center of Europe, and is divided into four distinct terrains: the Tatras range of the Carpathian Mountains in the south (the highest peak being 8199 feet), the hills to the immediate north, the central lowlands that form the heart of the country, and the swamps and dunes that border the Baltic. The great ages of glaciation that shaped Poland's terrain also left the loam and loess soils of the Polish plain some of the richest in the world. With almost ten thousand, Poland has one of the highest density of lakes of in the world; in Europe only Finland has higher. The climate is universally temperate, with precipitation falling throughout the year, although winter tends to be drier than summer. The rich soils and the moderate climate make the country an agricultural powerhouse, one of the world's leading producers of sugar beets and triticale wheat, and Europe's primary source for potatoes and rye. Indeed, Poland has been declared by some to be the "breadbasket of the European Union."</Text>

			<Text>On the fringes of the ancient Mediterranean and Near East civilizations, the peoples of Poland progressed relatively ignored by them through the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages of human development; the first settlements date back approximately 7500 years. Part of the great migrations that occurred near the end of the Western Roman Empire, the Slavs moved into the region. There they settled, first as tribal organizations and later coalescing into small kingdoms. From one of these came Mieszko, the first ruler of the "Poles" to be mentioned in historical records.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]According to the semi-legendary account, the Polanie tribe, centered on the fortified settlement of Gniezno, was ruled by Mieszko, who forged close ties with the Wislanie tribe living around Krakow. When Great Moravia, of which the Wislanie were a part, was destroyed by the Magyars around 960 AD, Mieszko united the Polanie and the Wislanie, founding the Piast Dynasty. Convinced by Roman Catholic missionaries from Bohemia to the south, Mieszko converted to Christianity and was baptized in 966; despite some debate, most scholars accept this date as the beginning of modern Poland.</Text>

			<Text>A series of strong successors to Mieszko I slowly converted the pagan Poles to Christianity, created a strong kingdom, and integrated Poland into the broader European culture. His son Boleslaw I established a purely Polish-Catholic ecclesiastical organization, and his secular authority was recognized by the Germanic Holy Roman Emperor. This led to Boleslaw's coronation in 1025 AD, making him the first "King of Poland." By the end of the century, Poland stretched from the Baltic to the Carpathians, loosely establishing its historical borders.  However, upon the death of Boleslaw III in 1138, with no tradition of primogeniture, the kingdom was divided among his several sons. The resulting fragmentation led to continuous internal conflict and external pressures throughout the 12th and 13th centuries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Wladyslaw (1261-1333 AD), known as "the Elbow-High," a minor duke of Piast lineage, spent his life reunifying the realm. In defending Poland, King Wladyslaw I waged crusades against the pagan Lithuanians and Mongols, as well as war to expel the Teutonic Knights. Upon Wladyslaw's death, his even more able son, Casimir III, took the throne. Casimir the Great would not only secure his father's gains through astute diplomacy and brief, victorious warfare, but make Poland a center of culture and learning and trade. He more than doubled the size of the kingdom, reorganized the nation's economy and legal system, and provided the impetus for the establishment of Poland's first university. Under Casimir's liberal rule, Poland became a haven for the dispossessed and persecuted; Germans settled in the cities, Armenian and Slavic refugees in the rural lowlands, and thousands of Jews settled and flourished across the country. However, having no male heirs, Casimir the Great was the last Piast king, dying in 1370.</Text>

			<Text>Casimir had designated as his successor his nephew, Louis I of Hungary, whose brief reign in Poland proved uneventful. After Louis's death in 1382 AD, the Polish nobles selected his younger daughter Jadwiga as queen. Four years later the nobles elected Grand Duke of Lithuania Jogalia (in Poland, known as Wladyslaw Jagiello) king after he married Jadwiga and converted to Catholicism. Coming to the aid of the Lithuanians locked in a vicious war with the Teutonic Knights, Wladyslaw II brought the Poles into the conflict in 1401. At Grunwald in July 1410, after one of the most ferocious battles of the Middle Ages, his combined Lithuanian-Polish force won a victory so overwhelming that the Teutonic Order was virtually annihilated, with most of its leaders killed or captured. The victory secured Wladyshaw's throne for his lifetime, and established the resultant Jagiellon Dynasty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Jagiellon monarchs would spend the following decades at war with their covetous neighbors, against the resurgent Teutonic Knights, the Duchy of Prussia, the kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and, to the south, the Ottoman Turks and the Crimean Tatars, the latter launching no less that 75 separate incursions between 1474 and 1569. Overall, Poland's kings were able to maintain its borders and influence throughout the dynasty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More significant and lasting than the military successes and failures were the social and scientific changes under the Jagiellons. In 1505 AD, the Nihil Novi Act transferred most legislative power from the monarch to the Sejm, a parliament composed of the Polish nobility, a dramatic step towards democracy. Protestant Reformation movements, notably that led by John Hus of Bohemia, made inroads into Polish Catholicism and resulted in the establishment of laws promoting religious tolerance. Renaissance ideals evoked in the Jagiellon kings Sigismund I and Sigismund II an urge to promote Polish arts and culture, which flourished through the 1500s. And in 1543, the year of his death, his epochal work confirming a heliocentric model of the solar system was published by Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.</Text>

			<Text>Spurred by nationalism, democratic precepts, and concerns about foreign threats, in June 1569 the Sejm passed an act establishing the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a unified federal state with an elected monarch but which was governed primarily by the nobility through local assemblies and a central parliament. In July, the childless Sigismund II, last of Jagiellon dynasty, accepted and signed the act. Although the commonwealth is credited with instituting a period of stability and prosperity and the spread of Western culture to areas such as the Ukraine and western Russia, it found itself repeatedly embroiled in conflicts with Russia, Sweden, the Ottomans, and Cossack uprisings. The toll of these wars, notably Poland-Lithuania's involvement in the Great Northern War (1700-1721 AD), coupled with a succession of weak elected kings, left the nation desperately in need of internal political reform. During the middle years of the 18th Century, the Sejm moved to implement commercial, military, social and educational reforms, which included the Commission of National Education in 1773, the first state-sponsored education system in Europe.</Text>

			<Text>These efforts at reform, which threatened to return Poland to its previous glory, provoked the growing powers bordering it to intervene. In 1792, the First Partition occurred when Russia, Austria and Prussia occupied portions of the country. Following the short Polish-Russian War, Prussia and Russia executed the Second Partition, which stripped Poland of so much territory as to leave it incapable of supporting itself economically or militarily. In 1795 the Third Partition by Austria, Russia and Prussia ceded the nation's last holdings to these powers and independent Poland ceased to exist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]From 1792 through 1918, Poland was effectively an occupied country, with brief periods of relative autonomy. In 1807 AD, the emperor Napoleon recreated the free Duchy of Warsaw, but after the Napoleonic Wars the Congress of Vienna again divided Polish lands among the victors. The decades of partition were also marked by numerous Polish rebellions seeking independence, notably the November 1830 uprising and the January 1863 revolt, both of which sought liberation for those areas under tsarist Russian rule. Despite the oppression, Poland did profit from broad industrialization and modernization programs instituted by the occupying powers, especially in the areas under the relatively enlightened administration of Prussia. This enforced modernization would make Poland more economically and politically viable in the 20th Century. Nonetheless, Russian, and to a lesser extent Austrian and Prussian, control was tenuous and troubled; as the composer Wybicki, whose 1797 mazurka would become the Polish anthem in 1927, wrote, "Poland is not yet lost ..."</Text>

			<Text>Shortly after the armistice in November 1918, and seizing the opportunity granted by the turmoil of the Russian Revolution, Polish nationalists declared the creation of the Second Polish Republic. The Western Allies had already agreed to the reconstitution of Poland as the thirteenth of American President Wilson's famed Fourteen Points. The Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921 forced Lenin's Russia to accept Poland's freedom, and incidentally halted Communism's advance into Europe. But the threat of totalitarian regimes in Russia and Germany, coupled with the world-wide depression, brought the right-wing nationalists of the Sanacja movement to power and the government became increasingly authoritarian.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Sanacja movement controlled Poland until Nazi Germany's invasion in 1939 set off World War II. Joined by Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Wehrmacht quickly overran what Winston Churchill would declare as the "first ally." German and Russian occupation was brutal and efficient; of all the nations involved in the war, Poland suffered the highest percentage of population loss, over six million - roughly one-fifth of the pre-war population, almost half of them Polish Jews. The German invasion of the Soviet Union would result in the eventual "liberation" of Poland by Russian forces, which proved unwilling to depart. At the insistence of Stalin, Great Britain and the United States sanctioned the creation of a provisional, pro-Communist coalition government for Poland. In 1952, the People's Republic of Poland was officially proclaimed, and it immediately became a pivotal part of the Iron Curtain and member of the Warsaw Pact throughout the Cold War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Communist rule was harsh and costly for Poland. Despite widespread opposition and outcry, eastern portions of the country were permanently ceded to the Soviet Union. Repressive policies limited every aspect of Polish life, from cultural expression to religion to travel to educational and economic opportunity for individuals. The nation's wealth, both natural and industrial, was plundered for the good of Soviet Russia, leaving Poland a virtual pauper on the world stage. Despite all this, Poland was at the time considered one of the least repressive states of the Iron Curtain.</Text>

			<Text>Labor turmoil in the 1980s led to the founding of the trade union Solidarnosc (Solidarity), which over time became a force in Polish politics. Despite persecution and the imposition of martial law, the movement eroded the dominance of the Polish Communist Party throughout the following decade. As the Soviet Union dissolved and the Communist regime there collapsed, Solidarity prospered. In 1989, it had a hand in forcing Poland's first free (albeit partially so) parliamentary elections. The next year, Lech Walesa, the Solidarity candidate, won the presidency; Russian domination and Communist rule in Poland effectively ended. Within short order, the Solidarity-led government returned civil liberties to the Polish people and turned Poland's socialistic economy into a modern market-driven one.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After two generations of facing eastward, democratic Poland resumed its significant role in the cultural, economic and political life of Europe. In 1999, Poland joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to insure regional security. The Poles then voted to join the European Union, becoming a full member of the economic dynamo in May 2004. Having returned to its traditions of freedom, self-reliance and tolerance, Poland can again revel in its rich and diverse past.</Text>

But their most distinctive accoutrement was the huge "wings," wooden frames attached to either the saddle or the rider's shoulders, covered with eagle, swan, goose or ostrich feathers.

Bordered by New Zealand to the west, Hawai'i to the north and Easter Island to the east, the region includes over 1,000 inhabited islands.  The name was originally introduced by French writer Charles de Brosses in 1756 to describe all the Pacific islands, but it was later limited to its current definition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The islands as a whole are volcanic in nature, many with idyllic white beaches, palm trees, and clear lagoons - quintessential island paradises.

			<Text>The ancient history of the Polynesian peoples is still shrouded in mystery, but archeologists and anthropologists currently agree that one of three theories explains how the islands were originally settled.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first theory, the Express Train model, suggests that some 3,000 years ago settlers expanded westward out of Taiwan over the course of roughly 1,000 years.  They mixed little with any other natives they encountered, explaining current Polynesian's genetic and linguistic characteristics.  The other two theories, the Entangled Bank and Slow Boat models, describe a longer migration pattern, one which includes mixing and interactions with all the native populaces, specifically the Melanesians.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Regardless of how long it took the first settlers to reach western Polynesia, the path they took has been charted with a fair degree of confidence.  The northernmost point, Hawai'i, was settled around 500 AD, followed by New Zealand in 1000 AD.  The exact date for when the Polynesians discovered Easter Island is still debated.  Some archaeological evidence suggests that the island was first inhabited between 300 and 500 AD, but more recently the date 800 has come into favor.  Other scientists believe that the island wasn't inhabited until as late as 1200.</Text>

			<Text>The Polynesian triangle is a vast one, with each side measuring roughly 4,000 miles.  To cover this amount of distance over the open ocean required an astonishing degree of naval technology, navigational aptitude, and bravery.  Using the technique of wayfinding, navigators memorized the motion of specific stars, weather, local wildlife patterns, and the direction of waves on the ocean.  They passed this information down orally to new generations of navigators, the secrets closely guarded by these elite families.  To aid in the dangerous crossings, they also developed outrigger supports for their canoes, allowing them to safely cross the vast ocean.  Many of these techniques and navigational aids are still passed down and used by modern Polynesian sailors.</Text>

			<Text>Polynesian settlers arrived on the banks of present day Hawai'i sometime around 500 AD, although some evidence does suggest it may have been as early as 300 AD.  These early inhabitants were probably from the Marquesas Islands, over 4,000 miles south of Hawai'i.  A second wave of immigrants may have arrived from Raiatea and Bora Bora in the 11th century, or even from Tahiti.  Some archaeologists favor the Tahitian theory, as an ancient Hawaiian folktale speaks of a man called Pa'ao, conclusively of Tahitian descent. These historians believe that the wave of Tahitian settlers brought with them the line of high chiefs, the Kapu system of laws, and the religious practice of human sacrifice.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Evidence also exists that the Polynesians sailed back across the Pacific once encountering these new lands, spreading American fauna and flora throughout the islands.  For example, the sweet potato - a Native American plant - was found widespread through the Polynesian islands when European travelers first encountered the Polynesian settlements.</Text>

			<Text>Inhabited since prehistoric times, Portugal was reached by Phoenician and later Carthaginian traders in the first millennium BC, there meeting Celtic tribes that had pushed into Iberia across the Pyrenees. Over the following centuries, the Romans, Suebi and Visigoths ruled the peninsula; but the history of Portugal might be said to begin with the Muslim invasion in 711 AD. During the Reconquista, Portugal was born as an independent Christian kingdom in 1139. Spearheading the "Age of Discovery," in the 15th and 16th centuries Portugal would establish the first global empire, stretching from South America to Africa to the Far East. The 1800s saw the dismantling of that empire, Brazilian independence in 1822 being the most serious blow to the power and prestige of Portugal. After the 1910 revolution which ended the monarchy, Portugal suffered through a succession of juntas and dictatorships until democratic elections were finally held in 1975. A new constitution in 1976 and membership in the EEC in 1986 insured that it would remain a progressive democracy. The erroneous view that Portugal has been no more than an outpost on the fringe of Europe was summarized by American journalist Richard H. Davis, who wrote, "Portugal is a high hill with a white watch tower on it flying signal flags. It is apparently inhabited by one man who lives in a long row of yellow houses with red roofs, and populated by sheep who do grand acts of balancing on the side of the hill." But, with its rich history and culture, and now one of the world's most globalized nations, Portugal is much, much more.</Text>

			<Text>The modern nation of Portugal occupies a portion of the Iberian Peninsula in Europe, as well as two archipelagos in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores. Not a large country, it nevertheless offers a diversity of terrain, ranging from the low-lying coast to rolling plains in the south to the Estrela Mountains, rising to 6500 feet at their highest point. The Azores lie 1019 miles west of Lisbon, straddling the mid-Atlantic Ridge; Madeira is 605 miles southwest of Lisbon. Three rivers arise in the Meseta, the central plateau of Spain, and flow through Portugal to the Atlantic; these are the Duro in the north, the Tejo in the center, and the Guadiana along the southeastern border. Portugal's climate is Mediterranean. Despite cooler temperatures in the mountains, it is one of Europe's warmest countries. Average annual rainfall ranges from 118 inches in the northern mountains to less than 12 along a stretch of the Duro. The archipelagos have a climate classified as Maritime Temperate, although Madeira is considerably drier than the Azores. With humans having been settled in the area for thousands of years, little is left of the original flora and fauna. The most notable vegetation is the several species of pine and oak. Portugal has the usual mammalian and avian species common across Iberia. On the other hand, Portuguese waters are among the richest in the world in terms of biodiversity, with thousands of species of fish including several of sardine, tuna and mackerel.</Text>

			<Text>A distinct human culture emerges in Portugal in the Mesolithic period, c. 5500 BC. Within 2000 years, Neolithic tribes from Andalusia moved into Portugal, bringing agriculture, pottery and the working of soft metals. At some point prior to 500 BC, Iron-Age Celtic peoples crossed into Iberia from the north, supplanting the Neolithic inhabitants. Around the same time, voyagers from Phoenicia and Carthage established trading posts and settlements. When Rome gained control of the peninsula in 201 BC as result of the Second Punic War, the Lusitani federation resisted Roman rule from its fortresses in the west until the Celtic tribes were at last suppressed around 140 BC. In 25 BC, Caesar Augustus founded Augusta Emerita (modern Merida) as the capital of the province of Lusitania, which encompassed all of Portugal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the Western Roman Empire declined, a Germanic tribe, the Suebi, crossed from Gaul into Iberia. There they settled in southern Galicia, annexed Lusitania, and overran the rest of the peninsula. They in turn were supplanted by the Visigoths, who after a period left Iberia for North Africa. By 550 AD the Suebic kingdom had been restored and its king converted to Catholicism; but the Gothic kingdom was weak and divided, plagued by decades of unrest. When Muslim forces invaded in 711 AD, the only serious resistance was centered on Merida. Within two decades, the Moors overran most of Portugal and Galicia. In 756, Abd al-Rahman I established the Umayyad caliphate at Cordoba.</Text>

			<Text>Portugal would remain under Muslim rule for the next five-and-a-half centuries. In 1031 AD the Caliphate of Cordoba was dissolved into 23 separate "taifa" kingdoms, each with its own emir answerable to Damascus. Most of Portugal fell under the Taifa of Badajoz, but incessant warfare among the taifa led to conquest by the Almoravids from Morocco in 1086, who were in turn supplanted by the Almohad dynasty in 1147.  The Moorish rule of al-Andalus, the Muslim portion of Iberia, was by turns enlightened and ruthless. Only the northern kingdom of Asturias remained Christian, defeating the Moors several times to retain its independence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fifty years after Charles Martel turned back the Muslims at the Battle of Tours, Charlemagne opened the Christian effort to reclaim Iberia in his invasion of 778 AD. Making common cause with Asturias, the Franks and Teutonic Knights would spend the next 500 years slowly pushing the Moors back until by 1300 the only Muslim holdings in the peninsula were centered on the Emirate of Granada on the Mediterranean coast. In doing so, the crusaders created a number of Christian kingdoms in Iberia: Navarre in 824; Leon in 910; Aragon in 1035; Castile in 1037 ... and Portugal in 1139 AD.</Text>

			<Text>The county of Portugal, a fiefdom of the Kingdom of Leon, was awarded to Alfonso Henrique by the king for his service in the efforts to drive back the Muslims. In 1128, the newly created Count of Portugal defeated his mother's forces to insure his sole reign. For the next decade, Henrique conducted a continuous campaign against the Moors until, at the Battle of Ouique in July 1139, he won a decisive victory. Immediately after, he was unanimously proclaimed King Alfonso I of Portugal by his soldiers. Alfonso established his Cortes at Lamego, where he was officially crowned by the Archbishop of Braga. The new kingdom was recognized as an independent Christian state by the King of Leon and Castile in 1143, and by Pope Alexander III in 1179.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Alfonso I and his successors continued their push southward against the Moors. In 1249, Portugal's Reconquista ended with the capture of the Algarve region, giving the country its present mainland borders. Following the Reconquista, Iberia was largely peaceful, and the kingdom prospered both economically and culturally. In 1383, John I of Castile, son-in-law to the aging and heirless king of Portugal, claimed the throne. A faction of lesser Portuguese nobles and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later King John I), defeated the Castilians and the House of Aviz ascended to rule Portugal.</Text>

			<Text>John I of Portugal soon found an outlet for the restless among his adventurous sons. Long a maritime people, the Portuguese would be leaders in the voyages of exploration, in the process building a globe-spanning empire. The empire began modestly enough with the conquest of its first overseas outpost, the Muslim city of Ceuta on the north coast of Africa in 1415 AD. Under the patronage and direction of John's third son, Infante Henry - better known as Henry the Navigator (1394-1460) - Portuguese captains would soon after discover Madeira and the Azores, sparking the first wave of Portuguese colonization. Throughout the rest of the century, the Portuguese would sail south along the African coast, claiming territories, as they sought a route around it to India and the East.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Vasco de Gama final opened a sea route to India in 1498, bringing the wealth of the East to Portugal. Two years later, the errant fleet of Pedro Cabral would discover and claim the land of Brazil for the crown. A decade after that, Afonso de Albuquerque would conquer Goa in India, Ormuz on the Persian Strait, and Malacca in Malaysia. Other Portuguese merchants would establish trading posts along the shores of India, Taiwan, Japan and Timor. By the beginning of the 16th Century, the small nation of Portugal held dominion over the sea lanes of the Indian and South Atlantic oceans, making its economic, military and political power the rival of any in Europe.</Text>

			<Text>The Portuguese succession crisis of 1580 would lead to a union of Spain and Portugal under Philip II of Spain; although still a sovereign nation, this union deprived Portugal of a separate foreign policy, which in turn led to its embroilment in Spanish wars in Europe and abroad. Spurred by the diversion of income from its overseas colonies and trade to Spanish coffers, in 1640 AD an uprising of Portuguese nobles would restore independence to Portugal, in the form of the House of Braganza, which would supply rulers for both Portugal and Brazil.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the next 150 years, Portugal would remain largely untroubled by the politics of Europe. With the exception of a brief Spanish invasion during the Seven Years War, the Portuguese crown and people were content to enjoy the fruits of their colonial empire and peace. That is, until French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte intervened. Portugal had managed, despite being allied with Great Britain for over four centuries, to remain out of the turmoil of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1807, after the Prince Regent Joao - serving in place of his incapacitated mother Maria I - refused to join the Continental Blockade, which banned British imports to Europe, French and Spanish troops invaded Portugal. Unable to resist, in November, the prince along with the administration and court (about 10,000 people) fled across the Atlantic to Brazil.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although Portugal would be liberated by guerrillas and Anglo-Portuguese forces under the command of Wellington, the five-year occupation and the relocation of the government would herald a slow but inexorable decline that lasted into the 20th Century. The erosion of the colonial empire, most significantly the independence of Brazil in 1822, would cripple Portugal's economy. With the exception of colonial affairs and revolts, the government largely maintained an unofficial policy of isolationism. The nation fell behind other European countries both socially and technologically. Agriculture, including the fishing industry, and tourism became the major sources of income; Portugal came to be increasingly viewed as a "sleepy backwater of Europe."</Text>

			<Text>Twice during this period, in 1892 AD and again in 1902, King Dom Carlos I was forced to declare Portugal bankrupt. In both cases, the announcements were followed by protests, riots, social turmoil, localized revolts, and widespread criticism of the monarchy. This culminated in the assassination in February 1908 of the king and the heir apparent, his son Luis Filipe. Carlos' second son, Manuel II would assume the crown, but was unable to improve conditions. In October 1910, a popular revolution would discard the monarchy and establish a free republic. But economic instability, social chaos, and political unrest were fertile grounds for radicalism. In response, a 1926 coup d'etat led by the military established the Ditadura Nacional ("National Dictatorship"). Governed by a series of military juntas, Portugal's fortunes and influence continued to slip. Beginning in 1960, independence movements in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea resulted in the Portuguese Colonial War (1961-1974). As a result Portugal faced trade and arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions by the international community.</Text>

Facing a tide of dissent, both external and internal, the junta was finally swept away by the Carnation Revolution, a relatively bloodless left-wing military coup in April 1974. The revolution led to independence for the remaining overseas territories, as well as the restoration of democracy after a two-year transition period. The Portuguese constitution was rewritten in 1976 AD to accommodate both socialist and communist principles. Since then, the government has swung between neosocialism and neoliberalism. Land reforms and nationalizations were undertaken, and Portugal was obliged to twice allow International Monetary Fund stabilization programs to recover economically. In 1986, Portugal joined the EEC, and subsequently the European Union. In 1999, the last Portuguese colony, Macau, was handed over to the Republic of China.

			<Text>As the Portuguese extended their explorations and trading ventures further along the African coast and to the Far East, they needed a larger, sturdier ship capable of long voyages. The Nau, often referred to as a "carrack" or "Indiaman" by the English, evolved from the square-rigged cog widely used for commerce in the late Middle Ages. The design was perfected by Portuguese merchants in the late 1400s; the Nau came to be a three- or four-deck ocean-going vessel with three or four masts, with a broad beam stable in the high seas of the Atlantic, and capable of carrying provisions and cargo for a lengthy trip. It had a rounded stern and a high forecastle incorporated into the bow, the first ocean-going vessel with such. Its large storage holds meant that it could traverse great distances between landfalls, making it a mainstay in the Portuguese merchant fleet. The Nau would be supplanted by the Galleon on the ocean trade routes by the 1600s.</Text>

Initially created as an institute of research, the Chiphyonjon would eventually be tasked with the creation of a Korean alphabet to aid the common people in their understanding of the Korean language.  Until this time, Korea had relied on the Chinese "Hanja" script, incorporated into the Korean dialect, for all written works. However, this script was not widely understood by the masses, and Sejong sought to change this trend of illiteracy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Originally known as "Hunminjeongeum," literally meaning "The Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People," this native Korean script would usher in a new era of literacy and understanding for the common citizens of Korea. First published in 1446, it would be several years before the new script found wide acceptance. To this day, October 9th, the original date of publication, is celebrated as "Hangul Day" throughout South Korea.</Text>

			<Text>Sejong's legacy is one of great benevolence, led by his strong belief that all people were worthy of his respect, not only the subjects within his kingdom, but even the so-called "barbarian tribes" scattered throughout Asia. The standard by which he measured his own success as a leader was the happiness and prosperity of his people, their welfare being his highest priority. As king, Sejong would provide surplus food supplies to the poor and elderly, and frequently abolished taxes on farmers and occasionally entire provinces that had experienced hardships due to weather or poor crop yields. Sejong was also known for inviting the elderly to banquets in their honor, regardless of the rank or social status of those attending.</Text>

Sejong believed it was unjust to hold citizens accountable for violating the law without ensuring they were provided a means to understand the laws they had broken. Despite the reluctance of his ministers, Sejong ordered the entirety of the Korean legal code be put on public display, for all to see.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sejong also opposed the death penalty, and informed judges that it was not to be used unless absolutely necessary. His implementation of "The Law of Three Appeals" allowed the accused up to three appeals to the king, ensuring they were provided with an opportunity to speak on their own behalf.</Text>

			<Text>Under Sejong, Korea began the development of various early gunpowder weapons, most famously the "Hwach'a," or "Fire Vehicle." Specifically designed as an anti-infantry weapon, the Hwach'a was a wheeled platform capable of launching dozens of gunpowder-propelled arrows across the battlefield. Although limited in use during Sejong's time, the Hwach'a would become a crucial defensive weapon throughout the Korean peninsula for centuries to come. During the Battle of Haengju in 1593, three thousand Korean soldiers repelled an invading Japanese force of over 30,000 by successfully utilizing the Hwach'a, inflicting over 10,000 casualities.</Text>

			<Text>The Comanche were a branch of the Shoshone driven southward into Oklahoma and northern Texas by increasing pressure of the Northern Plains Indians. As Hunter-gatherers, under conditions of incessant conflict with other Indian peoples and Mexican and American settlers, the migratory Comanche developed a horse-warrior culture. Mounted on sturdy plains ponies, Comanche boys were taught to ride at a very early age. The warriors were armed with obsidian-tipped spears, devastating against opposing warriors on foot, and with bows and later rifles. The favored style of combat was guerilla warfare: short, intense, close-in mounted attacks aimed at killing as many of the enemy as possible and driving off their livestock. The so-called Comanche Wars, beginning with their first raids against Spanish outposts in New Mexico in the 1700s, raged nearly continuously until the last bands were subdued by the U.S. Army in 1875.</Text>

In the winter of 1805, Charbonneau was hired as a guide and interpreter by the Lewis and Clark expedition. However, since the Frenchman did not speak Shoshone, the explorers agreed to have the pregnant Sacagawea accompany the expedition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jim Bridger, one of the foremost American frontiersmen, had two Shoshone wives; his third marriage, in 1850 AD, was to the daughter of Chief Washakie, a renowned warchief of the Eastern Shoshone later decorated by the United States government for his help in their campaigns against the Northern Plains Indians.</Text>

			<Text>Among the Native American tribes of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, some members were trusted as superior scouts, relied upon to carry out critical duties for the nomads. Called by a variety of titles, these "pathfinders" tracked game and enemies, scouted routes for migration, spied on foes and interlopers, and protected the winter encampments. So skilled were they that the armies of the major powers hired them as scouts and advisors, beginning as early as the Pequot War (1637-1638 AD) when the English colonists of Massachusetts Bay were aided by scouts of the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes. However, with the end of the frontier and the confinement of Native American tribes to reservations, the role of the pathfinder faded.</Text>

			<Text>"I don't speak your language, and you don't speak mine. But I still understand you. I don't need to walk in your footsteps if I can see the footprints you left behind." Unfortunately, this Shoshone saying did not apply when the white man came into their lands. The Shoshone arose from the intermingling of various indigenous peoples who had lived in the western part of North America for thousands of years; the Shoshone tongue, one of the Uto-Aztecan languages, was their most distinctive characteristic, and so common that, despite divergent dialects, members from distant tribes could converse with ease. At their greatest extent, the Shoshone stretched from northern Idaho to northern Arizona, from eastern California to western Montana. The first contacts between the Shoshone and whites included the passage of the Lewis and Clark Expedition through their northern lands in 1805 AD and the arrival of fur trappers and traders in the Rocky Mountains in the 1820s. The white explorers were followed by white pioneers, notably the Mormon settlements in Utah around the Great Salt Lake at the heart of Shoshone tribal lands. For the next three generations Shoshone chiefs fought against the loss of their hunting grounds, destruction of their culture, and forced relocation by the U.S. Army. But, while valiant, the fight was eventually futile. By 1890 the last Shoshone had been relocated to reservations administered by the U.S. Indian Bureau.</Text>

			<Text>The traditional homeland of the Shoshone stretched across the arid Great Basin region of the United States. It included all of what is now Utah and Nevada, as well as portions of Oregon, Idaho, Montana, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. The Great Basin is the largest endorheic watershed in North America, and includes terrain ranging from the highest point (Mount Whitney) to the lowest point (Badwater Basin) in the contiguous United States. The primary watershed is the Humboldt River, draining some 17,000 square miles. Although mostly characterized by the North American desert eco-region, large portions of the Shoshone land was forested mountain ranges and prairie valleys. The tribal lands also include numerous lakes, among these the Great Salt Lake and Lake Tahoe, the continent's largest alpine lake. Extensive deserts ranged by the Shoshone include the Black Rock, Great Salt Lake, Sevier, Smoke Creek, Mojave and Sonoran, as well as the Nevada salt flats. Climate ranges from desert arid to alpine temperate across the region, with temperature extremes above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the south to well below zero in the north. The rich diversity of flora and fauna allowed the Shoshone to thrive as hunter-gatherers, with their primary game the plentiful pronghorn and mule deer and plains buffalo.</Text>

			<Text>As time passed, the Shoshone divided into three large subgroups. The Western, or "unmounted," Shoshone were centered in Nevada, with tribes in Oregon and California; among the latter are the Timbisha Shoshone which has for centuries lived in the Death and Panamint valleys and surrounding mountains. The Northern, or "horse," Shoshone lands spanned Idaho, northern Utah, and western Wyoming. The Eastern, or Wind River, Shoshone lived in Wyoming, southern Montana, and western Colorado. In the early 1700s AD, the Blackfoot, Crow and Piegan Indians to the north and the Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho to the east were better armed and had an abundant supply of horses. Consequently, these tribes gradually pushed the Shoshone south from the northern plains and west across the Continental Divide. In the process, some of the Eastern Shoshone migrated south into west Texas, evolving into the Comanche, considered by some to be a fourth subgroup of the Shoshone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]From 1780 through 1782, smallpox ravaged the natives of the Great Plains, especially the Shoshone. Moving northward from Spanish settlements in Mexico and Texas beginning in 1779 AD, the smallpox pandemic may have cost the Shoshone between one-third and one-half their number. Although it brought a lull in the pressure from Blackfoot, Sioux and Cheyenne, also suffering its effects, according to tribal oral histories the disease "badly shattered" the Eastern Shoshone, leaving only isolated bands unable and unwilling to resist the arrival of the white Americans.</Text>

			<Text>By 1800 AD, the Western Shoshone had co-existed with Spanish and Mexican settlers for several generations. Meanwhile, the lands of the Eastern Shoshone were being explored by isolated American frontiersmen and explorers. But the best documented first contact between the whites and the Shoshone occurred when the Lewis and Clark Expedition entered Shoshone lands in Montana in August 1805. Dispatched by President Jefferson to explore and map the northern and western portions of the Louisiana Purchase, the expedition enjoyed cordial relations with the Northern Shoshone, thanks in part to the presence of Sacagawea, a Lemhi Shoshone accompanying the party. Meanwhile, American frontiersmen such as Jim Bridger began moving into the Rocky Mountains in the 1820s, and established annual fur trading rendezvous in the Wind River, Green River and Snake River regions. At these rendezvous, held from 1825 through 1840, the Shoshone in Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Utah not only acquired goods and weapons, but became familiar with the ways of the whites.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following the fur traders came the settlers. Relations with the waves of homesteaders, miners, ranchers and tradesmen that migrated into or through the Shoshone lands were not always as friendly as those with the explorers and frontiersmen. The eastern and northern portions of the Shoshone lands had been "acquired" by the United States through the Louisiana Purchase; the treaty in 1848 AD that ended the Mexican-American War ceded the remainder of the Shoshone tribal lands to the Americans. The California and Oregon trails, the primary routes to the west coast territories of the United States, cut through the heart of this tribal territory. In the lands of the Eastern Shoshone, white sodbusters and cattlemen spread across the plains and eastern slopes of the Rockies. The discovery of gold in California (1848) and Montana (1864) and of the silver Comstock Lode in Nevada (1858) brought an influx of settlers and fortune seekers into the heartland of the Shoshone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most significant white incursion occurred when Brigham Young led his band of Mormons into the Salt Lake basin in 1846, seeking to found a faith-based republic free from the persecution they had suffered in Missouri and Illinois. For centuries the Ute and Northern Shoshone had hunted and migrated through the basin, but had no permanent camps there. By December 1847, two thousand Mormons had settled around the Salt Lake in Utah; an estimated 70,000 more followed in wagon trains over the next decade. Upon his arrival, Young had selected a site for the construction of a temple for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; around that Salt Lake City grew. From the basin, Mormon missionary settlers fanned outward. In 1847 the town of Bountiful was founded, followed by Ogden in 1848 and Provo in 1849.</Text>

			<Text>The response to the American expansion varied greatly among the Shoshone tribes. The Eastern Shoshone, under the leadership of Chief Washakie, reached an amiable accord with the whites. At the urging of his son-in-law Jim Bridger, Washakie agreed to participate in the council meetings at Fort Laramie in 1851 AD. There he signed a treaty pledging cooperation with the Americans for rights to hunt and camp in the Wind River Range. In 1868, another treaty created the Shoshone and Bannock Indian Agency located in west-central Wyoming. Unique among reservations, the U.S. government permitted Washakie and his chieftains to select the land, about three million acres, they would settle. In the ongoing Indian Wars, the Eastern Shoshone supplied scouts and guides to the U.S. Army, notably in General Crook's campaign against the Sioux and Cheyenne following the defeat of Custer at the Little Bighorn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In general, the Western Shoshone tribes co-existed peacefully with the white settlers and miners that entered their lands. This was largely due to the fact that the territory - extensive deserts and dry hills - they inhabited was inhospitable and barren. Lacking the warrior tradition of the Northern and Eastern Shoshone, the members of the Idaho and Oregon tribes subsisted on herded sheep, while those in Nevada and California were primitive hunter-gatherers. The nomadic bands, none numbering more than two hundred members, were gradually relocated onto small reservations in Nevada during the 1880s and 1890s. Despite some opposition, the several Western Shoshone tribes were combined into the Te-Mouks Bands Council under the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By contrast, the Northern Shoshone resisted the incursion of the whites. Initially, the tribes established an accord with the Mormon settlers, whose elders acquiesced to supply food and goods to replace the loss of game habitat to farming and timber operations. Although at times troubled by minor skirmishes and the occasional murder, from 1847 AD until the late 1850s the Shoshone and Mormons maintained the peace. But the increase in migrant wagon trains and of gold prospectors in their hunting lands took ever more game; in 1859, Jacob Forney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Utah Territory, recognizing the impact of the migrants, wrote, "The Indians ... have become impoverished by the introduction of a white population." Desperate and starving, the Shoshone began attacking isolated farms and stealing cattle as a matter of survival. Mormon support for the natives eroded, and the donations of food and supplies to the Shoshone gradually ceased.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Commencing in 1860 AD, Shoshone chiefs such as Pocatello and Bear Hunter sent raiding parties to attack wagon trains, mail riders, telegraph crews and parties of miners in an effort to curb the influx. The Lincoln administration mired in the Civil War and concerned about the security of communication routes to California and Oregon, uncertain of the loyalties of the Mormons, ordered U.S. Army troops into the area to quell the disturbances. In October 1862, Colonel Patrick Connor led a detachment of troops from California to establish a base three miles east of Salt Lake City. Meanwhile, a number of Shoshone tribes gathered at their annual winter encampment in Cache Valley. A series of small but bloody incidents between miners and settlers and Shoshone braves brought Connor to mount an attack on the encampment with about 300 infantry and cavalry on the morning of January 29, 1863.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although Pocatello led his tribe away when scouts brought word of the approaching force, the other chiefs determined to remain. Bear Hunter and other chiefs assumed that a settlement could be reached, perhaps with the Shoshone paying reparations. Instead, Connor attacked without negotiations. According to witnesses, when the Shoshone fought back, the American officers appeared to lose control of the cavalrymen, who began a wholesale slaughter. By the time it ended, nearly 500 native men, women and children had been killed, most of them non-combatants, in what came to be known as the Bear River Massacre. Among the dead was Bear Hunter; the surviving nine chiefs led by Sagwitch surrendered and their tribes forced onto reservations under the provisions of the Treaty of Box Elder in July 1863. After eluding capture for nearly five years, Pocatello's starving and diminished tribe surrendered at last and was confined to the Fort Hall Reservation as well.</Text>

			<Text>Reservation life was brutal and harsh, made worse by the broken promises and corruption of the U.S. Indian Bureau. Unable to find sufficient game and usually unable to farm the poor lands they were assigned, many of the captive Shoshone died of starvation and disease. The American administrators repeatedly failed to supply food, medicine, clothing and supplies to the reservation Indians. In response, as happened elsewhere, several incidents of Shoshone despair and defiance occurred when tribes left the reservations. Such doomed uprisings led to the Bannock War in 1878 involving the Northern Shoshone and Bannock tribes and the Sheepeater Indian War in 1879 involving about 300 Western Shoshone. Eventually, reforms in the 1920s and 1930s brought the reservation tribes the rights of American citizenship, lifted most restrictions, and granted special privileges to the tribal councils.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Today, the remaining members of the Shoshone tribes - approximately 12,000 - live on several reservations in Wyoming, Idaho and Nevada, the largest being the Wind River Reservation of the Eastern Shoshone in Wyoming. The other major Shoshone reservation, the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho, originally encompassed 1.8 million acres, but has been reduced to 544,000 acres due to enforced land sales and the creation of the American Falls Reservoir. Since the 1934 act granting recognition and citizenship, the Te-Mouk have established a series of private communes on purchased land in Nevada, such as the Death Valley Indian Community and the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony.</Text>

			<Text>Archeological evidence suggests that humans first arrived on the Iberian Peninsula about 32,000 years ago, the Altamira cave paintings providing a famous artifact of their travels. The peninsula was settled between two main groups, the Iberians and the Celts, the former populating the southern and eastern areas with the latter inhabiting the northern and western stretches.  The peninsula placed the Celts and Iberians in a prime position for commerce, and many Phoenician and Greek merchants set up a thriving gold and silver trade, predominately within the city of Tartessos, located at present-day Seville.  A few Phoenician, Greek, and Carthaginian trading colonies were founded along the Mediterranean coast of the peninsula, though the local populace retained control over most of their area, despite this influx of foreign gold and power.</Text>

			<Text>This continued until roughly 210 BC, when the Romans captured the Carthaginian colonies during the Second Punic War.  At this point, the Romans launched a campaign into the heart of the Iberian Peninsula, where they conquered nearly all of the landmass. Over the course of the next 500 years, the Celts and Iberians were steadily "Romanized" - local aristocratic families were inducted into the Roman nobility, Roman roads and trading posts dotted the land, and new systems of irrigation techniques were established, including the famous aqueducts.   Christianity was also introduced during this time and was quickly adopted by the local people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rome, however, began to lose hold of the peninsula (now being referred to as "Hispania" or "Iberia") when a Germanic invasion of Gaul pushed Suevi and Vandal peoples into Iberia in 409 AD. The displaced tribes set up a new kingdom in modern day Galicia and Portugal, and Rome lacked the resources to stop them.  The Vandals quickly spread across Iberia, leaving the Romans with a small southern holding along the coast, Spania.  The Byzantine Romans hoped to retake Iberia from this vantage point, but soon the entire peninsula fell under Visigothic rule.</Text>

The large, Moorish armies crossed from North Africa into Gibraltar and conquered nearly the whole of Iberia in seven short years, from 711-718 AD.   The new Islamic powers allowed the Christians and the Jews to continue their religious practices, but did require them to pay special taxes and submit to a few discriminatory practices. Despite these minor (for the given time) prejudices, many of the locals began to convert to Islam.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The invaders themselves were hardly unified despite their shared religion and purpose, and soon groups of Moors were splitting off and forming settlements of their own, primarily in the Valencia and Granada regions.  In the 11th century the Muslim territories fractured again, allowing some of the remaining Christian kingdoms to expand their boundaries.  Christians and Muslims continued to wrest for control of Iberia for centuries, resulting in the creation of the Reconquista.</Text>

			<Text>Officially starting with the Battle of Covadonga in 722 (but not gaining momentum until much later), the Reconquista was the name given to the Christians' attempt to reclaim Iberia from Muslim rule.  Many important Christian kingdoms were founded by the Reconquista, such as Asturias and Aragon, but most of the Muslim kingdoms stubbornly held onto their land.  For the next 700 years, a battle for the Iberian Peninsula raged between the Christians and the Muslims: strongholds were built and fell, power bases and balances shifted, and borders were redrawn on nearly a yearly basis.  Despite the slow encroachment of the Christian-led kingdoms across Iberia, no clear victor presented itself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, this all changed with the fateful union of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, joined by the marriage of Isabella I and Ferdinand II in 1469.  The two monarchs led a pointed attack against the Islamic stronghold of Granada, and in 1492 they finally ended the 781-year rule of the Muslims in Iberia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1492 was an important year for the monarchs; Christopher Columbus, with the patronage of Isabella, arrived in America (leading to the colonization of the New World), and the Iberian Jews were ordered to convert to Christianity or face expulsion or even death under the Inquisition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The new, unified kingdom of Isabella and Ferdinand became known as Espaa (or Spain) and with her wealthy colonies in the New World became the first "world power" of the time.</Text>

It was said, and rightfully so, that the sun always shone somewhere in the Spanish Empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Spain's new trade routes with the New World not only provided new knowledge and culture, but also new resources in the form of precious metals ( i.e., gold), spices, and plants. Spain's Golden Age also saw the creation of intellectual and spiritual reforms as well, starting with the escalation of humanism, beginnings of the Protestant Reformation, and the founding of the School of Salamanca.</Text>

			<Text>With great power comes great responsibility, at least if you don't want Barbary pirates to conduct slave raids along your empire's coastal holdings. Besides the growing pirate and Ottoman threat, Spain found itself routinely at war with France.  Religious unrest and wars shook the Catholic empire, as the Protestant Reformation dragged the empire into ever-increasing military engagements across Europe.  What unrest and religion didn't touch, plague did, and in the 1650's, the empire was rocked by the Great Plague of Seville.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]From this point forward, Spain's power and influence went into a gradual, and then not-so-gradual decline. She began to lose her European holdings, primarily from the separation of Portugal and the Netherlands, and then suffered military setbacks from the highly destructive Thirty Years War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Wars and more wars threatened and decimated the once proud empire for the next two centuries.  In the 18th century, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the country by trickery, claiming he was on his way to Portugal.  Then in the early 19th century, a nationalist revolt to overthrow their French- occupationalist government led to the Spanish War of Independence, or the Peninsular War.  Despite their eventual victory over the French (mostly due to Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign) the country was thrown into political turmoil.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Spain soon saw itself in turn facing multiple wars of independence from its own foreign colonies, cumulating in the Spanish-American War. The 20th century didn't bring much change for the fallen empire - The Spanish Civil War of the 1930s brought Fascism and an authoritarian government to the country, claiming over half a million lives in the process.  This war is also commonly credited as the first battle of World War II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It wasn't until the death of General Francisco Franco, in 1975, that the monarchy was restored and things began to look up for Spain for the first time in the past 300 years.</Text>

A progressive and economically powerful nation in the present-day, Sweden's early history was chronicled in the Norse Sagas, within which the first records of their legendary kings appeared. Although there is no precise date associated with the kingdom's formation, over time the loosely collaborated Viking chiefdoms gave way to a united Swedish people.

			<Text>Long before the Vikings, Sweden was inhabited by tribal peoples who migrated throughout the region. As early as 12,000 BC, hunter-gatherers living in Sweden moved with the seasons and eventually formed small fishing communities utilizing primitive flint and slate tools. These early tribes developed more cohesive agricultural-based societies starting in the Neolithic era and continuing into the Nordic Bronze Age around 1700 BC. An influx of imported bronze allowed for the use of progressively more advanced tools and weapons during this period.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the dawn of the Viking Age approached in the new millennium, Sweden was primarily inhabited by several large Germanic tribes. The original "Swedes" were initially only a singular tribe living in small kingdoms and chiefdoms throughout Svealand, the historical center of Swedish development. Neighbored by the Geats to the south and the Gutes on the isle of Gotland in the Baltic, the Swedes were eventually unified with their neighboring tribes, although the date of their unification is still a mystery. The collaboration of these early tribal kingdoms throughout the Viking era implies a gradual fusion of their territory.</Text>

			<Text>The conquests and expansion of the Vikings into central Europe wreaked havoc on unsuspecting settlements across the region. During the 7th and 8th centuries, the Vikings typically set sail from Scandinavia each spring in search of plunder, returning in the fall burdened with spoils. While their Danish counterparts were best known for raids in England and France, the Vikings of Sweden primarily sailed across the Baltic Sea and along the river inlets into the Russian frontier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Moving into Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine during the 9th century, many of the Swedish Vikings settled in these eastern lands, where they came to be known as the Rus people. Although there are a number of theories as to the origin of their name, the most common belief is that it derived from the Swedish region of Roslagen, meaning "Land of the Rowers." After capturing the city of Kiev in the mid-9th century, the Rus formed a state that survived for nearly 400 years until the arrival of the Mongols in the 13th century. This "Land of Rus" is notably credited as the namesake for the modern nation of Russia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following long held tradition, the Swedish Vikings honored their most historic victories and revered leaders through the use of runestones. Inscribed with runic glyphs and symbols, these monumental stones provide some of the earliest records of the Vikings' exploits, and are scattered throughout the regions they once held dominion over.</Text>

			<Text>Throughout the first millennium AD, Sweden was a loose collaboration of independent provinces. Although a number of early kings are mentioned in the Norse sagas, attempting to separate legend from factual history leaves their lineage and succession still somewhat muddled. Olaf Skotkonung, son of King Eric the Victorious, ruled from 995 until 1022, and is considered the first to truly unite the Swedish tribes under one king.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the mid-12th Century, noted regent Birger Jarl served Sweden as "Jarl" (the equivalent of an Earl or Viceroy) during the reign of King Eric XI. Birger is credited with ending longstanding hostilities with rival Norway by negotiating the Treaty of Lodose, going so far as to marry his own daughter Rikissa to the son of Norwegian King Haakon IV. Birger is also thought to have had a hand in selecting the location for Sweden's future capital, Stockholm, as the first written evidence of the name Stockholm came from Birger's own letters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An unimaginable horror would strike Sweden in the 14th century with the arrival of the Black Death.

			<Text>From 1397 until 1523, Sweden was part of the Kalmar Union, which effectively united Sweden, Norway and Denmark under the rule of a single monarch. Although each of these nations was theoretically independent, in terms of foreign policy and action, the decisions of the Danish king were absolute. Sweden's involvement in the union was brought about by internal strife between then King Albert and the leading nobility, who had supported Albert during his succession until he attempted to reduce their assets and landholdings. Turning to Queen Margaret of Denmark, the nobility named her regent of their lands, and a force of Danish troops marched against Albert, defeating his armies in 1389.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Meeting in the Swedish town of Kalmar in 1397, the union was officially formed, under the stipulation that the monarch of the union would always be Danish. The Swedish nobility agreed to the union based on the promise by Margaret that their influence and holdings would be protected, and that Swedes would hold positions of authority within the country aside from the throne itself. A relative of Margaret's, Erik of Pomerania, was crowned as the first king of the new union, but his own ambitions quickly cast doubt on the promises made by Margaret.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Within 50 years, turmoil enveloped the union, as frequent conflicts initiated by the Danish king against Swedish trade partners riled the Swedish nobility and damaged the economy of Sweden. In 1440, King Eric was deposed, but this brought little peace to the union. Conflicts between Denmark and Sweden spilled over into the 16th century, until the rise of Gustav Eriksson.</Text>

			<Text>King Gustav I, also known as "Gustav Vasa," of the House Vasa, led a successful rebellion in 1521 against the Danish king Christian II, who ruled the Kalmar Union. Free from the grasp of the Danish monarch, Gustav was elected King of Sweden by the Riksdag in 1523, bringing an end to the union after more than a century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was the later rule of esteemed King Gustavus Adolphus who truly ushered in the "Great Power Era" of Sweden, a dramatic ascension of Swedish authority in Europe during the 17th century. Upon taking the throne in 1611, Adolphus found himself at the reins of a nation mired in conflict. His father Charles, having unseated the rightful king (and Charles's own nephew), Sigismund, in order to gain the crown, left Sweden on the brink of three wars. Adeptly navigating these domestic and foreign quarrels, Adolphus negotiated a fragile peace with Sigismund, while settling conflicts with Russia and Denmark in the following decade.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most famous of Adolphus's military achievements came during the Thirty Years' War, a great conflict that culminated with the defenders of Protestantism facing off against the Catholic forces of the Holy Roman Empire. Under Adolphus, Sweden's military was bolstered and modernized, and he effectively protected the Protestant movement through several key victories in the war. Although not involved from the onset, in 1630, Adolphus led the armies of Sweden in defense of the German Protestant states against the forces of the Holy Roman Empire. Regrettably, Adolphus was killed in 1632 while leading a charge at the Battle of Lutzen, robbing Sweden of her most honored general.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maintaining the prestige Sweden gained during the reign of Gustavus Adolphus was no easy task, but his successors Charles XI and XII were both skilled and respected leaders. Continuing the military improvements started under Adolphus, both kings came to utilize a specially trained force known as the Caroleans. The Carolean army emphasized quality over quantity, relying on skill and discipline rather than sheer force of numbers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the Great Northern War of 1700-1721, fought between Sweden and a united force led by Russia, the Caroleans overcame insurmountable odds, sometimes outnumbered 3 to 1, and still emerged victorious in repeated battles. Unfortunately, the Swedes were eventually overcome by the opposition forces, leading to an infamous retreat in 1718 known as the "Carolean Death March." When Charles XII fell in battle, an officer by the name of Carl Armfeldt retreated with his company of 5,000 men, marching headlong into a blizzard. Some 3,000 men died before the army finally made their way back to Sweden.</Text>

Controlling trade between the villages along the Euphrates and Tigris and the sea, Ur was favorably located for development into a commercial and political center. Founder of the first dynasty of Ur, Mesanepada oversaw the construction of docks and levees to control the annual river floods. By 2800 BC it had become one of the first Sumerian city-states, and trade routes between Mesopotamia and India, Ethiopia and Egypt passed through it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After a period of decline and stagnation, under Ur-Nammu Ur experienced a renaissance of Sumerian art, literature and culture. Historians' estimates make Ur the largest city in the world from 2030 through 1980 BC, with a population in excess of 65,000. But under the last three kings of the third dynasty Ur's influence and wealth declined; around 1940 BC the city was captured and sacked by the Elamites.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rebuilt shortly thereafter, Ur became part of the kingdom of Isin, later incorporated into the Babylonian Empire. Still an important religious center, its commercial influence declined, possibly as a result of a shift in the course of the Euphrates. After Babylon itself came under Persian control, Ur was largely ignored. Its population moved away; its walls and temples fell into ruin; its anchorage was buried in sand and soil. By the 4th Century BC, Ur was practically forgotten until rediscovered and partially excavated by the British vice counsel at Basra, John G. Taylor, beginning in 1854 AD.</Text>

			<Text>La serenissima ("the most serene" or "sublime") Republic of Venice was built on islands in a lagoon of the Adriatic Sea and became the greatest seaport of medieval and Renaissance Europe, the continent's commercial and cultural link with the East. Settled initially by Roman refugees from German and Hun invasions, in 726 AD the citizens of the city rose in rebellion against Byzantine rule, declared themselves a free republic, and elected the first of the 117 doges that would administer the city-state. From the 9th through the 12th centuries Venice developed into a naval and commercial power that dominated the Mediterranean trade routes from the Levant and Orient, from Morocco and Spain. Venetian merchant-explorers fanned out across Asia and Africa, bringing ever more wealth to the city, as well as making it one of the cultural centers of Europe. Venetian seamen would challenge both the Byzantine and Ottoman empires for supremacy along Mediterranean shores. Eventually, for reasons including the discovery of the New World and dynastic struggles among the European nations, Venice would decline in wealth, influence and power. In 1797 AD Napoleon conquered the city, and it would never again be an independent entity. However, since then Venice has held an unrivaled place in the world's collective imagination.

			<Text>Situated at the northeastern end of the Adriatic, Venice was built on an archipelago of 117 small islands lying in the crescent-shaped Laguna Veneta. The lagoon is roughly 32 miles long, reaching from the marshes of Jesolo to the town of Chioggia at the southern end. The shallow waters of the lagoon are sheltered by a line of sandbanks with three gaps, permitting tidal flow and shipping passage into the city. The lagoon is divided into two zones: the living and the dead. The latter is comprised of salt inlets and marshes formed by the sedimentary deposits of the dozens of small streams and the rivers Po and Piave; the latter is the main portion of the lagoon, separated from the sea by the strip of land known as the Lido. The climate of Venice is temperate, determined by the weather patterns of the Alps to the north and Adriatic to the south. Summers are marked by moderate temperatures, averaging in the 80s Fahrenheit, and winter temperatures in the 30s, with frequent fog and mist. Annual average rainfall is about 34 inches.

			<Text>While there are no records that detail the earliest settlement of Venice, Roman historians indicate that refugees from cities such as Padua, Aquileia and Treviso moved into the lagoon basin, displaced by the incursions of the Huns and Lombards in the 5th Century AD. There the Romans mixed with the itinerant fishermen and salt miners to create villages on several of the islands. The founding of the city itself is generally accepted as the date of the dedication of its first Christian church, San Giacomo on the island of Rialto, in March 421. The city was considered part of the Exarchate of Ravenna, which was overseen by a viceroy appointed by the Byzantine emperor in Constantinople. In 726 AD, the people of the Exarchate rebelled against Byzantine rule at the urging of Pope Gregory II, who was concerned with the spread of Eastern Orthodox Christianity into the West. In the turmoil, the citizens of the Venetian lagoon declared their independence and elected their own leader. Their choice, Ursus, was the first of an unbroken line of doges elected from the foremost families of the city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A long series of disputes among the powerful families over the role and rights of the doge did not halt the boom in trade for the new naval power. Protected by their fleet, Venetians established trading posts in the major Mediterranean ports, and wealth flowed into the city from as far as the Christian Slavic kingdoms to Moslem states in Spain and North Africa. The increase in personal incomes led to stability by creating a broader ruling class capable of limiting the power of the doge, as well as giving rise to a sense of national identity. Despite efforts by various popes, by Charlemagne, and by King Pepin of Lombardy to curtail or end Venetian economic and military growth, the city prospered. In 775 AD an episcopal see (i.e., diocese) was established on the Venetian island of Olivolo, signifying an accord between the popes and the doges. Two events marked the growing stature and influence of Venice more than any others during this period: the construction of St. Mark's Basilica in 832 AD to house supposed relics of St. Mark the Evangelist (the city's patron saint) stolen by Venetian merchants from Alexandria, and extensive fortifications were built on several islands to guard the lagoon and city.</Text>

			<Text>In the early 1100s, the republic embarked on a massive shipbuilding program, centered on the Venetian Arsenal, a 110-acre shipyard in the heart of the city; within a generation Venice had 36,000 sailors manning 3300 warships, the largest navy in the Mediterranean. By 1200 AD, Venice had seized a number of cities and established fortified outposts along the Adriatic coast in Dalmatia and Istria. A succession of expansionist doges also acquired territories on the mainland to the north, primarily to guarantee Venetian Alpine trade routes and secure a supply of wheat for the city. Having the most powerful navy in the Mediterranean and seeking to control the trade in salt, Venice acquired control of most of the islands in the Aegean from the declining Byzantine Empire, including Cyprus and Crete. By the standards of medieval Europe, Venetian rule of its territories was relatively enlightened, and the citizens of towns such as Bergamo, Brescia, Verona and Ragusa often enthusiastically supported Venice in its wars and ventures.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Venice became an imperial power following the Fourth Crusade. The aged and blind but brilliant Doge Enrico Dandolo "took the cross" and brought Venice into the crusade, which saw Constantinople captured and sacked in April 1204 AD. Before his death a year later, Dandolo played a key role in the subsequent treaty partitioning the Byzantine Empire, gaining new lands and trading concessions from both the Byzantines and the crusader states.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Early in the Middle Ages, the government of the republic took on its enduring form. Similar in many ways to that of the Roman Republic, it was embodied in the Grand Council, an assembly of the members of the city's oldest and richest families. This council appointed all public officials and elected a Senate of 200 to 300 individuals. To handle vital matters of state, a ducal council, the Council of Ten which included the doge, was elected from the ranks of the Grand Council. Common citizens had the right, theoretically, to grant or deny approval of those nominated for the major posts, including the dogeship.</Text>

			<Text>The fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD to the Ottoman Turks brought Venice to the fore in the European resistance to their advances; the seizure of the Venetian city of Morea in 1499 gave the Turks access to the Adriatic itself and insured there would be no accord between the two empires. For the next century, even as the Ottomans strangled Venetian trade with the East and Africa, Venice was locked in a struggle with the Turks for dominance. The conflicts continued until the Battle of Lepanto, when the Venetian led Christian fleet decisively defeated a Turkish armada, in October 1571. Although the victory insured that the Ottomans would not spread into the West, it also marked the beginning of a long decline in Venetian fortunes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nonetheless, the opulence and wealth of Venice was still renowned, and the nobles of Venice became the leading patrons of the Italian Renaissance that spanned the 14th through 16th centuries. Already a cosmopolitan city, Venice saw an influx of artists such as Titian and native-born talents such as Giovanni Bellini and Tintoretto, composers such as Gabrieli, and architects such as Longhena (one of the greatest Baroque designers). At the same time, progressive scholars such as Galileo, who taught at the prestigious Padua University, found refuge in liberal Venice's territories. The newly invented printing press spread through Europe during this period, and by 1482 AD Venice was the printing capital of the world; the leading printer in the city, Aldus Manutius, created the first, affordable books, cheaper because of their paperbacks. Even as its political fortunes waned, Venice's cultural prominence waxed. As a traveler from Milan in the 1500s wrote, Venice was "the most triumphant city I have ever seen ... [it is] impossible to describe the beauty, magnificence and wealth of this unique assemblage."</Text>

			<Text>A number of factors contributed to the decline of Venice. The Black Death devastated the city in 1348, in 1575 through 1577, and again in 1630 AD; the latter outbreak killed some 50,000 citizens, roughly a third of the city's population. Advances in shipbuilding and armaments by the nations of Portugal, England, Holland and Scandinavia rendered the republic's war-galleys and trading vessels obsolete. In 1498 AD, Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, opening a sea route to the riches of the East; Portuguese, English and Dutch traders soon supplanted the Venetians in Europe's economy. Meanwhile, Spain was bringing more wealth from the New World than Venice could hope to match. As Spain, France and the Holy Roman Empire fought for hegemony over the Italian peninsula, Venice's political influence dwindled, even as military matters drained the republic's coffers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By 1508 AD, these powers - together with the Papacy, Hungarians, Savoyards and Ferrarese - made common cause in the League of Cambrai against the long Venetian dominance of the Mediterranean. Although the republic was saved from complete defeat by internal bickering in the league, most of its mainland holdings were lost. Although the victory at Lepanto bolstered Venice's international reputation for a period, the battle caused the Turks to turn back to complete their slow conquest of the Eastern Mediterranean. After a four-year campaign, in 1669, Venice lost Crete, its last holding east of Italy. Although a successful campaign to re-establish itself in the east was culminated with the liberation of Morea, the effort proved exhobitant in terms of both lives and money; in 1718, the hard-won territories were returned to the Ottomans in exchange for trading concessions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the next decades, the republic stagnated, living on the memories of past glory. A succession of ineffectual doges left Venice isolated politically, economically and diplomatically. The tides of the French Revolution would finally sweep it away. Napoleon, ever ruthlessly practical in matters military, claimed that the city-state was a threat to his line of retreat during the Austrian campaign of 1797. The Peace of Leoben that resulted from Austria's defeat left Venice without a viable ally to resist French demands; in May 1797, the last doge, Ludovico Manin, was deposed at Napoleon's insistence. Later that same year, the city was ceded to Austria by France in the Treaty of Campo Formio.</Text>

			<Text>"Lying at the junction of two navigable rivers, the Vilnia and the Neris, some 194 miles from the Baltic, Vilnius was settled as a trading post deep in the woodlands of Lithuania. The town is first mentioned in written records in 1323 AD, when German Jews were invited to relocate to the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by Duke Gediminas, who promised religious tolerance and commercial opportunities. Over the following decades under the duke and his sons the duchy expanded until it encompassed most of modern Lithuania, Belarus, the Ukraine, Transnistria, and portions of Poland and northern Russia. With the Union of Lublin in 1569, the city became an important mercantile center in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this period, Vilnius expanded dramatically. Migrants were welcomed by the authorities, and thousands of Slavs, Germans and Jews moved into the booming city. Polish kings and Lithuanian dukes undertook extensive building projects, not the least of which was fortification with extensive city walls and nine fortified gates. In 1579, King Stefan Bathory founded the institution that would evolve into the Vilniaus universitetus, the oldest university in the Baltic States, which quickly became one of the most important scientific and cultural centers in the Commonwealth. Guilds of several types were established, and the city served as the primary center for trade between Scandinavia and western Europe and the interior of Poland and northern Russia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But the 17th Century brought disaster. During the Russo-Polish War of 1654-1667, the city was captured by Tsarist troops, pillaged and burned and its population massacred. In 1710, an outbreak of the bubonic plague killed an estimated 35,000 citizens. A series of devastating fires destroyed much of the city during the first half of the 1700s. In 1795, the third partition of Poland saw Vilnius become part of the Russian Empire, where it remained until the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920, when Lithuanian independence was recognized. However, in 1922 Poland annexed the region, and the city would be under nominal Polish rule until World War II, after which it was again occupied by Russian forces. Not until 1990, with the secession of the Lithuanian SSR from collapsing Soviet Russia, would Vilnius again be self-ruled, becoming the capital of modern Lithuania."</Text>

			<Text>"According to Maori legend, the Hawaiki chief Kupe arrived on the North Island of New Zealand around 925 AD after having sailed there by canoe, besting numerous sea monsters and demons to reach this promised land. Whatever the truth of that may be, in September 1839 an expedition of the London-based New Zealand Company arrived and established a landing on a flat area at the mouth of the Hutt River. The next year, the ship Aurora arrived with 150 settlers from England. The initial site proving too swampy and prone to flooding, the newcomers relocated their settlement plans across the sheltered bay and the company directors named the town Wellington (the town of Petone now sits on the site of the original landing). In 1865, the city was declared the new capital of the colony, replacing Auckland which had been made the seat of the nascent government in 1841. It was argued by the colonial administration that Wellington, with its magnificent harbor and more central location, would serve that purpose better.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Wellington lies on the Cook Strait, on hills to the southwest of the bay. On his first voyage of exploration, Royal Navy Captain James Cook, searching for the rumored continent of Terra Australis, reached the islands of New Zealand in 1770 AD. He circumnavigated and mapped the entire coastline, and made special note of the sheltered natural harbor where the New Zealand Company would establish Wellington. For most of its history, the 27 square-mile anchorage was known as Port Nicholson. After the capital was established, Wellington Harbour quickly became the most important port on the islands, serving the needs of both British naval and commercial vessels. It is today the largest container port in the region, and a tanker terminus was constructed at the industrial suburb of Seaview. In 1895 the Union Steamship Company established regular service to and from the port, and for more than a century Wellington has been the primary terminal for ferry service between the nations islands and beyond."</Text>

Although the city was well-established within the Holy Roman Empire as the seat of power for the Elector of Saxony, it was Martin Luther's revolt that put Wittenberg on the map.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While teaching theology at the University of Wittenberg, Martin Luther first expressed his distaste for the selling of indulgences - the process of paying the Catholic Church for the forgiveness of sin. In 1517, Martin Luther famously nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, sparking the Protestant Reformation across Europe. Although it would take more than a century before the religious wars spurred by the Reformation were resolved, Wittenberg was always remembered as the wellspring for Martin Luther's dissidence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More recently, Wittenberg was consumed by the conflicts of World War II, although much of the city's historic center was spared from the devastation of the allied bombing campaign.

			<Text>"Impi" is the Zulu word for an armed body of men, although in common usage during the 1800s it referred to one of the Zulu empire's regiments. While impi had long been a feature of Zulu culture, their great chieftain Shaka instituted broad innovations upon his ascension to the throne in 1816 AD. In addition to their traditional club and throwing spear, Shaka armed his troops with the assegai, a short-shaft stabbing spear with a broad, foot-long blade. He introduced a larger, heavier cowhide shield (isihlangu) and trained his forces to quickly close with the enemy for devastating hand-to-hand combat. Strategically, the impi relied on speed and surprise to suddenly outnumber and overwhelm their enemy. Using such methods the Zulu won impressive victories, even against rifle-armed Europeans, although their own casualties were high.</Text>

			<Text>At the beginning of each winter, the all-conquering Zulu warriors would gather in their ancestral land to pledge themselves to new glories with the cry "Ngathi impi" (loosely: "Because of us, war"). This was the spirit with which Shaka would forge a Zulu empire, and Cetshwayo would challenge the mighty British. In 1816 AD, Shaka would seize the chieftainship of the relatively insignificant Zulu tribe; two years later he would assume leadership of his mentor's tribe, the Mtetwa. Over the course of the next decade Shaka and his warriors conquered and absorbed most of the tribes in the region, building the largest native empire ever seen in southern Africa. Upon Shaka's assassination, one of the murderers, his half-brother Dingane, would take the throne. Under successive chieftains, the Zulu would clash with the white settlers - first the Dutch Voortrekkers and then the British Cape Colony. The latter resulted in the Anglo-Dutch War; despite early victories, Cetshwayo was toppled in 1879. The Zulu lands were annexed by the British Empire in 1887. Although defeated and occupied, the Zulu fighting spirit was not buried, and Zulu leaders would eventually take a leading role in the end of apartheid and the direction of modern South Africa.</Text>

			<Text>The KwaZulu-Natal region, which encompasses what was the Zulu kingdom, has a subtropical climate. Summers are hot and humid; winters, clear and cool, with snow in the Drakensberg Mountains. The geography consists of three distinct terrains. The lowlands along the coast of the Indian Ocean are marked by deep ravines and subtropical forest thickets. Along the west and north are two mountainous areas, the Drakensburg and the Lebombo. Between the sea and the mountains lies the Natal Midlands, an undulating hilly plateau, rising gradually to the west. This midland region was the heart of the Zulu Empire, and is characterized by moist grasslands with pockets of Afromontane forest. It was in this region that the Zulu raised large herds of beef cattle, which figured prominently both in their economy and their culture.

			<Text>The Zulu were a small tribe of the Nguni people when Shaka seized the chieftainship with aid from Dingiswayo, the chief of the powerful Mtetwa. Shaka and his mother had been given sanctuary by the Mtetwa when exiled by Shaka's father. Under Dingiswayo's patronage, Shaka grew to be an imposing warrior, was given command of one of Dingiswayo's regiments, and served with distinction. During this period he perfected reforms of the weaponry (arming his units with the assegai, a broad-bladed spear with a two-foot shaft) and tactics (the "buffalo horns" formation, meant to encircle and annihilate an enemy force), and established an age-grade organization, whereby boys of similar ages were trained as warriors at military kraals known as Ikanda and fought together in the same regiment throughout their lives. In 1816, upon the death of his father, Shaka would outmaneuver and kill his older brother to seize control of the Zulu; being a relatively bloodless coup, the Zulu readily accepted him as their new chief.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Given exceptional latitude as a Mtetwa vassal, Shaka proceeded to ruthlessly use his new military forces to defeat and absorb several neighboring tribes, including his mother's. Upon Dingiswayo's murder at the hand of the Ndwandwe, Shaka moved quickly into the Mtetwa power vacuum, merging his holdings with that of his fallen mentor. Over the course of the next decade, the Zulu Kingdom would overrun and absorb most of the neighboring tribes. It would resist the first assault of the Ndwandwe; two years later, Shaka's forces would decisively defeat the Ndwandwe and their allies at the Battle of Mhlathuze River. As was his practice, Shaka would assimilate the remnants of these defeated tribes. By the time of Shaka's assassination in 1828, the Zulu kingdom had become an empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The impact of Shaka on African history cannot be underestimated. By 1825, he had conquered an area covered approximately 11,500 square miles. In the process he had established a warrior culture that dominated southeast Africa, reaching from the Tugela River in the south to the Drakensberg Mountains in the north. Although overshadowed by his military reforms, Shaka stabilized the agrarian economy and fostered trade throughout his empire. He established cordial relations with the encroaching Europeans, even as he warned his chieftains to resist their greed and culture. Perhaps the most eduring result of Shaka's reign was the mass migration of peoples known as the Mfecane ("the Scattering"), as tribes fleeing the Zulu expansion displaced other tribes which in turn radiated outward, changing the ethnic and cultural face of Africa forever.</Text>

			<Text>One of Shaka's assassins, his half-brother Dingane (1795-1840 AD), took the throne and proceeded to execute most of his royal kin, the exception being his half-brother Mpande. Dingane feared even more than his family the regiments of Shaka's army, many of whom remained loyal to Shaka's memory. To appease them, Dingane granted the older warriors the right to marry and to serve as militia rather than full-time soldiers; having eroded the Zulu martial superiority through these measures, lacking Shaka's military skills, Dingane faced successful rebellions among some of his subject tribes. Moreover, in 1837 Dingane agreed to cede Zulu lands south of the Tugela to the Voortrekkers, Dutch colonists expelled from the British Cape Colony. But he later murdered Piet Retief, leader of the Voortrekkers, and his diplomatic party at his royal kraal and then massacred some 500 Dutch men, women and children camped nearby. In response, about 450 rifle-armed Voortrekkers crushed Dingane's 10,000-man army at the Battle of Blood River in December 1838. Dingane burned his kraal and fled north.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mpande defected with 17,000 Zulu warriors and joined forces with the Dutch. In January 1840, Dingane was assassinated by disaffected officers in his army. Mpande (1798-1873 AD) replaced Dingane, and maintained a close relationship with Andries Pretorius, the new captain of the Voortrekkers. The Dutch, with Mpande's blessings, formed the Boer republic of Natalia, south of the Tugela and west of the British settlement at Port Natal. When war broke out between the Boers and the British, resulting in the annexation of the Dutch colony, Mpande shifted his allegiance to the British and remained on good terms with them until his death. Mpande was generally perceived as a weak leader by his people, in part due to his close relations with the encroaching whites and his inability to curb the ambitions of his sons, Cetshwayo and the younger Mbulazi. In 1852 a struggle for the succession broke out between the two, culminating in a pitched battle on the banks of the Tugela where Mbulazi was killed.</Text>

			<Text>In September 1873 AD when Mpande died Cetshwayo became ruler of the still-powerful Zulu Empire. As was customary among the Zulus, he created a new capital named Ulundi ("the High Place"). Fancying himself Shaka's first true successor, he readopted most of the military policies and practices of Shaka and, impressed by his observations of Dutch settlers, even armed some of his impi with muskets. Taking Shaka's final warning about the whites to heart, Cetshwayo banished Christian missionaries from his lands; he encouraged other tribes to rebel against Boer expansion into the Transvaal and himself began a policy of cattle raids into British territories along the Zulu borders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1878 AD, Sir Henry Frere, British Commissioner for South Africa, demanded reparations for the border incursions from 14 Zulu chieftains. Cetshwayo deemed the terms of the ultimatum unacceptable and put his regiments on a war footing. In December, British forces crossed the Tugela to enforce their terms and punish the Zulus. But the first invasion suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January, where the Zulu overwhelmed the main British column, causing some 1300 casualties, primarily among the British regulars. It was the worst defeat the British Army had suffered at the hands of an African force to date. However, Cetshwayo failed to turn the stunning victory into a strategic or diplomatic advantage. After a period of panic and planning, the British again crossed the Tugela, this time with more caution. A series of British victories followed, culminating in the siege and destruction of Ulundi. A month later, Cetshwayo was captured and taken first to Cape Town and then exiled to London, not to return to Africa until 1883 AD.</Text>

			<Text>The British divided the truncated Zulu Empire into 13 "sub-kingdoms," which soon erupted into conflict, destabilizing the colonial borders yet again. The British returned Cetshwayo to Africa, installing him as over a buffer territory carved from former Zulu lands in the hopes of restoring order. However, it was not long before Cetshwayo was attacked at Ulundi by one of the sub-kingdoms, the Zibhebhu, supported by Boer mercenaries. Cetshwayo was wounded but escaped to the kraal at Eshowe, where he died of complications from his injuries in February 1884.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The second sack of Ulundi is considered by historians to be the definitive end of the Zulu kingdom. Cetshwayo's son Dinuzulu, then 15, inherited the remnants. Recruiting Boers led by Louis Botha, he defeated the Zibhebhu and added their lands to his own. Forced to honor his pledge to the Boers, he ceded about half of his "Zululand" to them, where they formed an independent Dutch republic. This so alarmed the British that they annexed Dinuzulu's reduced kingdom in 1887 AD. The chief himself became embroiled in native politics, was arrested by the British in 1906 for his role in the Bambatha Rebellion, was tried for treason and sentenced to imprisonment on St. Helena Island. When the Union of South Africa was founded in 1910, Botha, the new nation's first prime minister, arranged for Dinuzulu to be returned to live out his last years on a farm in the Transvaal.</Text>

			<Text>Formed of four British colonies - the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal and Orange River - the Union of South Africa was a dominion of the British Empire with an autonomous government. Within the union, the Zulu were the largest ethnic group. In 1948, fearing the growing numbers and influence of the native tribes, leaders of the governing Afrikaner National Party created the apartheid laws to maintain white control while insuring racial separation. These "race laws" affected every aspect of social, political and cultural life; all blacks were required to carry passbooks containing fingerprints, photo and information of the bearer's access to "non-white" areas. In 1951, the Bantu Authorities Act established native reserves, known as "homelands," the largest of which was kwaZulu.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When the union was replaced with a republic under the constitution of 1961 AD, the apartheid laws were carried over. Moreover, through the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s the government instituted a policy of resettlement to force natives to relocate to and remain in their homelands. However, by the late 1980s apartheid was collapsing, under pressure from internal activists (notably the United Democratic Front) and international organizations such as the African National Congress and United Nations. Apartheid was finally dismantled in a series of negotiations from 1990 through 1993, culminating in free elections in April 1994. Throughout the period, Zulu nationalists played a prominent role as activists and politicians. In the process, the Zulu chieftainship was reestablished; although the Zulu king has no political power (but considerable cultural influence), in post-apartheid South Africa the position is constitutionally recognized and the succession guaranteed.</Text>

His oldest brother, Abdallah al-Ghalib was the designated heir, and he ascended the throne in 1557 AD following their father's death.

Raising an army with the assistance of the Ottomans (where al-Mansur and his brother had remained in exile), Abd al-Malik invaded Morocco and successfully deposed the usurper Abu Adallah Mohammed. Unfortunately for the two warring claimants to the Moroccan throne, they both died at the Battle of Ksar-el-Kabir in 1578, leaving Ahmad al-Mansur to ascend as Sultan.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Morocco's armies dealt severe losses to the opposing force, which included the armies of Portugal who had sided with the usurper king. In taking thousands of Portuguese prisoners, al-Mansur was able to deftly negotiate a steep ransom for their safe return - leaving Morocco's coffers replenished with Portuguese gold.</Text>

			<Text>Once firmly established on the throne, al-Mansur enjoyed newfound prestige as the leader of an emboldened Morocco flush with wealth. He immediately began efforts to reform the administrative system of his nation, implementing new forms of taxation.  He also looked to expand the reach of his empire through campaigns against neighboring Songhai, which he hoped would provide new sources of income for the kingdom. Despite victories and sacking multiple Songhai cities, the problems of administering such a distant land across the Sahara proved too much even al-Mansur.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unfortunately, the expenses involved in Al-Mansur's various projects - military and territorial expansion, outlays for new construction, and grand displays of cultural and artistic expression - led to the eventual depletion of Morocco's vast treasury. As the purse strings tightened, al-Mansur was forced to restrict his great ambitions for the kingdom. Morocco was also faced with a difficult task in maintaining control over the distant territories it conquered, and many of these areas eventually fell out of Moroccan control.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With Ahmad al-Mansur's passing in 1603 - being struck down by the plague - Morocco's power and influence began to wane. By 1620 the Songhai cities had been lost. Moroccan trade routes were usurped by others, and fiscal troubles plagued the sultanate. In the end, many of the advances garnered by al-Mansur's exceptional administrative and diplomatic skills were lost by his successors.</Text>

			<Text>Ashurbanipal, King of Assyria for over 40 years during the mid-6th Century BC, is most famously noted in history for his seemingly unquenchable thirst for knowledge, which he sustained through both careful negotiation and ruthless conquest. Whether through direct conflict or simply the threat of violence against those who refused him, Ashurbanipal sought to gather the texts and histories of a wide range of cultures and civilizations surrounding his empire. In forming the great archive of cuneiform manuscripts and stone tablets that bears his name, Ashurbanipal established one of the most remarkable libraries of ancient material found anywhere in the world.  Aside from his scholarly pursuits, Ashurbanipal was also known to be a fearsome warrior, who deftly managed both the military and administrative tasks required of him. As an intimidating force with both the intellect and might to lead the formidable Neo-Assyrian Empire, Ashurbanipal's legacy as one of Assyria's greatest kings has endured for more than two millennium.</Text>

			<Text>Although historical records from the period are intermittent, it's known that Ashurbanipal was born early in the 6th Century BC, towards the end of a nearly 1500-year period of Assyrian supremacy in the surrounding region. His father, Esarhaddon, was crown prince at the time of Ashurbanipal's birth, and saw to it that his son received training and education as both a soldier and a scholar. Raised in a small palace known as bit reduti ("House of Succession") in Nineveh, Ashurbanipal was given the palace when Esarhaddon named him crown prince in 672 BC following the death of Ashurbanipal's elder brother. His training there ranged from kingly pursuits such as horsemanship, chariotry, archery, craftsmanship and royal decorum to the likes of divination, mathematics and engineering. Although still debated, it has been speculated that Ashurbanipal may have been the first Assyrian king capable of both reading and writing, allowing him to understand a variety of ancient scripts and languages. At a young age he began handling administrative duties within the royal court of Assyria, managing a number of construction projects and appointing local prefects in his father's stead. Following his father's death in 669 BC, Ashurbanipal ascended to the throne and prepared himself to deal with a number of conflicts on the horizon.</Text>

			<Text>As is often the case with any change in rule, as king, Ashurbanipal was forced to deal with some of the troubling issues left behind by his father. Assyria was enbroiled in a war with neighboring Egypt, and Ashurbanipal was forced to take decisive action to secure his grip on the empire's distant territories. Swiftly deploying his forces, Ashurbanipal met with repeated successes in Egypt and - after further incursions by the Assyrian army - Ashurbanipal assured firm control over many of the contested regions, including Judah, Israel, Cyprus, and much of Asia Minor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A skilled administrator, Ashurbanipal dedicated much of his time to managing the needs of his people at home, despite devoting long days to coordinating the efforts of his military. By carefully selecting able and reliable regents and local rulers for the far-flung reaches of the Assyrian empire, Ashurbanipal was able to focus his own efforts elsewhere. His upbringing and education are credited with his skill in governance; the empire enjoyed relative stability and ongoing economic prosperity despite the conflicts of the region.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Taking great pride in his education and academic pursuits, Ashurbanipal was a patron of both the arts and sciences, and throughout his reign he brought both to the empire with unbridled enthusiasm. To fill his Royal Library at Nineveh, Ashurbanipal sent scribes across the empire to collect and copy texts of nearly any available subject. As with many ancient kings, Ashurbanipal also commissioned artists and sculptors to create depictions of the events occurring throughout the empire, along with numerous reliefs depicting his own personal accomplishments and talents.</Text>

Incorporating materials from a wide range of subjects - including folk tales, religious rites, medical and scientific works, and histories - the library is among the most extensive ever uncovered by modern archeologists. The Royal Library contained, among other literary treasures, the Enuma Elish, the Babylonian "Epic of Creation," and the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. English archaeologist and historian Sir Austen Henry Layard was the first to locate the library ruins in 1849, with most of the material he recovered being shipped to the British Museum, where it remains in their collection to this day.

Unrest in the urban centers and within the ranks of the military was worsened by the conflict between his brother Sinsharishkun, the general Sinshumulishir and the eventual king of Babylonia Nabopossar. This turmoil only served to strengthen the legacy of Ashurbanipal, as his people had enjoyed relative stability and prospered during his reign. In establishing the Royal Library, Ashurbanipal set the first standard for state-supported scholarship and provided modern scholars and historians with an unequaled cache of artifacts that has greatly contributed to our knowledge and understanding of the peoples and the kingdoms of his era.</Text>

The Huns purportedly massacred the populations of these cities, subjecting any survivors to a future of slavery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Sword of Attila, known as the "Sword of Mars" to the Romans, was the legendary weapon wielded by Attila that contributed to his renown as an invincible slayer of men. It was said that no man could look Attila directly in the eyes without flinching, his unflappable gaze proving too strong for even the most commanding of his rivals.

			<Text>Little is known of the early life of Attila before the death of his uncle Rua, who had led a loose confederation of Hunnic tribes north of the Danube River on various short-lived military campaigns. Attila and his brother Bleda took control of the Huns, sharing a dual kingship following Rua's death in 434.  Following in the footsteps of their uncle, the two kings initially launched attacks against the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) in hopes of generating a steady income of tribute. Unfortunately for both sides, the Romans often failed to keep their word, delivering little tribute and thus incurring swift and brutal reprisals from the Hunnic raiders. The saving grace for the Byzantines may have been Attila's western ambitions, where the Hunnic army occupied itself with fresh conflicts.</Text>

			<Text>The mysterious death of his brother Bleda in 445, some say by Attila's own hand, left Attila as the sole leader of an increasingly unified Hunnic force. In 447, Attila once again led his army into battle against the legions of the Eastern Roman Empire at the Battle of Utus, successfully defeating the Roman force, leaving little remaining opposition.  However, Attila's army suffered substantial casualties during the battle, which prevented him from seizing the Eastern Roman capital, Constantinople. Instead, Attila struck northward towards the Balkans (also Eastern Roman territory), sacking city after uncontested city, plundering everything his men could carry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After sweeping through the Eastern Roman Empire, Attila set his sights to the west. Moving swiftly across Europe, he launched successful attacks against the Visigoths throughout Gaul in 451-452. As the Hunnic horde marched onwards, many of the various tribal people they encountered joined Attila's force, some by choice, others compelled by intimidation. Regardless, the Huns were bolstered by these new recruits, and continued to pillage their way through the region until encountering a united Visigoth-Roman force on the fields of Gaul. At The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, Attila was turned back by the Roman-led force, the only major defeat in his lifetime, providing Rome and her allies a temporary reprieve.</Text>

During this exile, Valentinian promised his sister's hand in marriage to an unknown Roman senator. Upon learning of her betrothal, Honoria attempted to contact Attila and gain his assistance in escaping the marriage. For reasons unknown, she sent Attila her engagement ring, which Attila interpreted as a marriage proposal. Claiming half of the Western Roman Empire as his dowry, Attila moved his force to invade Italy, despite Valentinian's insistence that the proposal was invalid.</Text>

After sacking a number of cities in the northern reaches, Attila received numerous envoys from Valentinian, including Pope Leo I, all of whom pleaded with Attila to leave Italy without pursuing Rome further. For reasons that are unclear, Attila obliged (most likely due to lack of supplies). Shortly thereafter in 453, Attila died mysteriously. Some scarce evidence suggests that it may have been a simple nosebleed that toppled the mighty Hun on the night of his wedding, while other equally questionable accounts suggest he may have been assassinated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Roman historian Jordanes wrote that Attila's men cut their hair and slashed themselves with swords to honor Attila in death, stating "The greatest of all warriors should be mourned with no feminine lamentations and with no tears, but with the blood of men."</Text>

			<Text>Boudicca, legendary warrior queen of the Celtic Iceni tribe, is noted in history for decimating a number of Roman settlements while leading an uprising of Celtic tribes against the might of the Roman army occupying England in the 1st century AD.  Although historical records from this period are limited, mainly relying on the reports of Roman historians Tacitus and Cassius Dio, the story of Boudicca's uprising is generally accepted to have gone something like this: [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Boudicca's husband, King Prasutagus of Iceni, had long been an ally to the Romans and maintained a sovereign rule over his people during the Roman conquest of Britain. Upon his death, he is said to have named Boudicca and their two daughters as joint-heirs, in the hopes of maintaining the rights and nobility of his family line. With little regard for their old friends, the Romans swiftly moved to annex the Iceni territory, and it can be said with certainty that the Romans' brutality in the matter was unwavering. Boudicca was publicly flogged.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The outrage spurred by the Romans' disrespect and brutishness towards the Iceni led Boudicca and her people to organize a rebellion with the assistance of neighboring tribes, particularly the Trinovantes. Boudicca gathered a huge force, estimated at 70,000 or more, and marched to the Roman colony of Camulodunum. The Romans, unprepared for such a vast assault, were caught off guard and found no mercy at the hands of the rebellion. The city of Camulodunum was besieged and destroyed, and the rebel army proceeded next to the city of Londinium, destroying everything of value to the Romans in their wake. Verulamium was the 3rd and final city crushed during Boudicca's uprising, burned to the ground and it's Romans citizens massacred. In all, Boudicca's army is said to have killed over 80,000 Romans and pro-Roman Britons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Meeting at an unknown site in the English Midlands in 61 AD, the Roman Army and its collected legions finally faced the rebellious tribal force head-on.  Unfortunately for Boudicca, the Romans' extensive training and tactics would be the undoing of the uprising. Women and children, accompanying the rebel supply wagons, are said to have come to observe the battle and provide support. The presence of these observers on the field, however, would leave the rebels with little room to maneuver. The uprising was crushed, and some 70,000 to 80,000 rebels were killed in the ensuing battle and its aftermath. It is believed (although no means of confirmation exists) that Boudicca died by her own hand sometime shortly after the battle, the most common theory being that she consumed poison to avoid capture.</Text>

			<Text>While difficult to judge a legendary figure such as Boudicca, we can say for certain that the uprising she led against the Romans was rooted in a just cause, striking back at the occupation and the insufferable brutality the Romans inflicted upon the Celtic people.  Although the rebels under Boudicca's leadership slaughtered Roman soldiers and citizens alike, history does not judge her actions as unscrupulous, having also seen the ways of the unmerciful Romans. While there are few details of Boudicca's life before the rebellion, her legacy as a noble warrior, who died to defend the freedoms of her people, will live on in history for ages to come.</Text>

Although Casimir's predecessor, his father King Wladyslaw I, was respected for having reunited the divided realm, Casimir inherited a kingdom rife with challenges.

			<Text>Not long after ascending to the throne, Casimir was forced to deal with a number of political issues, not the least the unrest of the Polish nobility. In order to strengthen Poland's military, which relied heavily on the cooperation of the Polish nobles, Casimir was forced to relinquish a number of heretofore royal privileges to the nobles themselves. The Polish aristocracy now held a clear division between themselves and the common people, and their authority in matters dealing with those of lower standing, especially the growing merchant classes, was greatly strengthened. Although Casimir was forced into a position of comprise, his actions ensured that the feudal armies of Poland could be replenished and would recognize the crown's authority.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Casimir made great strides in efforts to improve the internal state of Poland, and counterbalance the new power of the nobles, through a number of initiatives. He standardized and stabilized the currency. Casimir ordered the construction of a number of new castles, churches, and even entire towns - providing new opportunities for trade and economic prosperity. Towns long since abandoned, and even areas said to have been devoid of any form of settlement were revitalized. In March 1347 Casimir introduced legal reforms and moved to establish a unified code, the Liber juris Teutonici, for the realm to protect the rights of the fledgling middle class. In enacting a form of the Magdeburg Rights - a German concept allowing for towns to exercise a certain degree of autonomy - he provided local merchants and craftsmen with a more stable regulation of trade, encouraging them to settle in cities across the nation. A special court was established in Krakow to arbitrate in all disputes and administer the laws uniformly. Hoping to educate a new generation of capable lawyers and administers, Casimir the Great founded the Academy of Krakow, now the Jagiellonian University, in 1364 AD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although historians have wondered what spurred Casimir's disposition towards the Jews of Poland, it is clear that he made every effort to afford them the same rights and protection all his subjects enjoyed. In 1334, Casimir reaffirmed the charters of 1264 protecting the rights of the Polish Jews, including laws prohibiting attempts at forced conversions to Christianity that had been largely ignored under previous rulers since. Casimir also secured their rights as merchants and traders, and welcomed Jewish integration into a unified Poland with a diverse population. The desecration of Jewish cemeteries and synagogues was declared a crime and vigorously enforced.</Text>

			<Text>Upon his ascension to the throne, Casimir's rule was tenuous, and disputed on all sides by foreign powers. The king of Bohemia himself claimed the Polish crown. The German Teutonic Knights had occupied the Polish territories of Kujawy and Dobrzyn in Pomerania. An undeclared, inconclusive war with Lithuania to the north threatened stability and trade in the bordering provinces. Polish claims to territories in the Ukraine were ignored by neighboring nations. To make matters worse, Poland had no allies of any importance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Relying on his skill in diplomacy, Casimir deftly negotiated new alliances and secured additional territory for Poland. The marriage of his sister Elisabeth to the king of Hungary brought him a dependable ally; to cement this alliance Casimir dropped his claims to Silesia. The Hungarian alliance allowed Casimir to forcefully occupy the former Polish duchies of Halic and Vladimir in "Red Russia" in 1340 and 1349 AD. Meanwhile, through negotiation, a pact was forged with Bohemia and its king dropped all claims to the Polish throne. This, in turn, led to a negotiated withdrawal of the Teutonic Knights from East Pomerania. Finally, Casimir agreed to pay tribute to the Golden Horde to avoid their frequent raids into Poland. As a result of Poland's growing power and its cordial relations with the Mongols, several Masovian princes in Russia declared themselves Casimir's vassels in 1351 and 1353.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Casimir wedded princesses from Lithuania, Germany, and Silesia - each helping secure peaceful relations with their homelands. Although he had four wives and several mistresses, Casimir had five daughters but no legitimate male heir. While Casimir was to arrange dynastic marriages for several of his daughters which further strengthened Poland's position, the lack of a son threatened unrest and war should he die. To provide a clear line of succession, in his last years Casimir named his nephew, Louis of Hungary, son of Elisabeth, as his heir. Louis was proclaimed king of Poland upon Casimir's death in 1370.</Text>

			<Text>It can be said that Casimir is viewed in history as an ideal medieval king - noble, prudent, diplomatic and capable of delegating authority when necessary. Although some of the territories were lost over the next century, by his death Casimir III had increased Poland's land to approximately 90,000 square miles (233,000 sq. km) from 50,000 in 1333 AD. Casimir showed great concern for the welfare of his people and his choices as king clearly reflect his efforts to improve the standing of Poland. By forming dependable alliances, aggressively pursuing domestic reforms, and avoiding needless conflicts, Casimir the Great truly earned his given title.</Text>

			<Text>The story of Dido, Queen of Carthage, is, as most legends are, filled with intrigue and deception. Retold through the words of Roman historians and later the esteemed poet Virgil in his epic the Aeneid, Dido's tale begins with her life as the daughter of King Mattan of Tyre.  The Kingdom of Tyre was part of the ancient Phoenician civilization, geographically located in what is today modern Lebanon. Dido, who was often referred to as "Elissa" in the ancient historical records, was heir to the throne of Tyre following her father's death, sometime around 800 BC. Named joint-ruler with her brother, Pygmalion, Dido's rule was not widely accepted by the people. Despite her father's intention for her to share the throne with her brother, Pygmalion was recognized as King of Tyre, and Dido was left with little authority.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Not long after, Dido was married to a priest named Acerbas, who, by some accounts may have been her uncle. Acerbas is said to have been possessed of considerable wealth, which he concealed by burying his treasures underground. King Pygmalion, knowing of this wealth, had Acerbas murdered in hopes of claiming the gold that would rightfully go to his sister. Although accounts vary, Dido eventually became aware of her husband's death at the hands of her brother. The ghost of Acerbas himself is said to have appeared before her one night and warned her to flee the kingdom, while at the same time revealing the location of his hidden gold. It was the careful formation of her plan to escape Pygmalion's grasp that provided history's first glimpse of the clever nature for which Dido was best known.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order to keep from arousing her brother's suspicions, Dido told Pygmalion she wished to travel the world, with the intention of sending tribute and gifts back to Tyre. Agreeing to her trip, Pygmalion provided Dido with a small fleet of ships and various servants to help her prepare for the journey. After quietly loading the ships with bags of gold from Acerbas' hoard, Dido set her plan in motion. In order to deceive Pygmalion, Dido ordered the servants to load bags filled with sand on to the upper decks, to be used as decoys. After setting sail, Dido declared the gold to be an offering to the spirit of her dead husband, and had the bags of sand thrown overboard into the sea. Pygmalion, thinking the gold was lost forever, made no attempt to pursue Dido or her party.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now searching for a new home, Dido and her party first stopped on the island of Cyprus, where a group of local stragglers joined her crew. Eventually they made landfall along the coast of northern Africa, and began negotiating a price with the local chieftain for a small piece of land on which to found their new settlement. As the agreement went, Dido could have as much land as she could encompass with a single ox hide, with the local leader believing he was getting quite a deal. The quick-witted Dido conceived of another angle on the proposal; by cutting the ox hide into thin strips, then into even smaller fibers, she created a length of rope long enough to encircle a wide area including a prominent hill nearby. Thus, the city of Carthage was founded, and Dido's legacy as a crafty and capable leader was sealed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dido ruled Carthage as its first queen, and, as the legend continues, was eventually the object of several suitors, including the Trojan prince Aeneas. In Virgil's account, Aeneas was brought to Carthage through the manipulative workings of the Greek gods. Dido and Aeneas became lovers, and when Aeneas left Dido to continue on his journey, Dido was so distraught that she committed suicide.</Text>

			<Text>Enrico Dandolo, the 42nd Doge of Venice, was famous for his piety and longevity, while equally infamous for his pivotal role in the Fourth Crusade which led to the sack of Constantinople and the collapse of the Byzantine Empire. What made this all the more remarkable was the fact that Enrico was blind. Born to a powerful family, Enrico Dandolo served the Republic as a diplomat for much of his life. Elected Doge in June 1192 AD at an advanced age, he nevertheless took up the post with vigor. In the following years he reformed the Venetian currency, as well as its legal system, and sought stronger ties with the Western powers. In 1202, the knights of the Fourth Crusade were stranded in Italy without funds to pay for ships. Dandolo "took the Cross" and made Venice the major financial backer for the crusade. This ultimately led to the attack on Constantinople in 1204, where the Doge was present and took an active part. He died shortly thereafter, and was buried in the Hagia Sophia.</Text>

			<Text>Born into one of the most powerful and influential families in Venice, young Enrico was groomed for a life of service to the Republic. His father Vitale was a famed jurist and member of the ducal court, a close advisor to the Doge Michiel. After a series of administrative posts, in 1171 AD at the age of 64 Enrico Dandolo entered the Venetian diplomatic service. In March of that year, the Byzantine emperor Comnenus had seized the property of thousands of Venetians living in his realm. Dandolo accompanied Doge Michiel on a disastrous military mission to Constantinople; upon returning to Venice, an irate mob killed Michiel, but Enrico escaped blame and was subsequently appointed ambassador to seek a diplomatic settlement with Byzantium. On his second mission, legend has it that so vigorous was Dandolo's protection of Venetian interests that the Byzantine emperor had him blinded. However, historical records show that Enrico Dandolo lost his sight gradually between 1174 and 1178, likely as the result of a severe blow to the head.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Returning without a treaty - one would not be signed between Venice and Byzantium until 1186 - Dandolo was dispatched as ambassador to the Kingdom of Sicily in 1171 AD and to Ferrara in 1191. His diplomatic abilities were rewarded with close cooperation with both to challenge and limit Byzantine influence in the western Mediterranean. In recognition of his services, in 1178 Dandolo was made one of the forty individuals commissioned to elect doges. When Doge Orio Mastropiero retired to a monastery, Enrico Dandolo was himself elected Doge of Venice in June 1192.</Text>

			<Text>Although elderly and blind, Enrico Dandolo proved a vigorous and able leader for Venice. In one of his first official actions, he reaffirmed the "ducal promise," codifying the duties and rights of the dogeship. In the next few months, drawing on his education in the law, he revised the Venetian penal code and published the first collection of civil statutes for the Republic. In 1194 AD he turned his attention to currency reform, making the silver Venetian grosso the primary coinage for trade throughout the Mediterranean.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dandolo was just as vigorous in his diplomatic dealings. Drawing on his previous experiences, he put an end to commercial disputes with Verona, concluding treaties with that city-state and with Treviso in 1192 AD. The Doge followed these triumphs with treaties with the Patriarch of Aquileia (1200), the King of Armenia (1201), the Holy Roman Emperor (1201) and rival Byzantium itself (1199). He also led Venice in successful military conflicts with Zara when that city tried to unite with Hungary, and with Pisa when that economic challenger attempted to establish outposts in Istria, which Dandolo claimed to be in Venice's zone of influence.</Text>

			<Text>Pope Innocent III came to the papacy in 1198 AD, preaching a new crusade to liberate the Holy Land. Largely ignored by European royalty, the call was taken up by Count Thibaut of Champagne and Count Boniface of Montferrat. Being short of funds, in 1201 the crusaders sent envoys to the maritime city-states to acquire transport to Egypt, where the crusaders planned to strike at the heart of the Ayyubid lands and from there free Palestine. Doge Dandolo agreed to supply transport for 33,000 troops - an ambitious number - in exchange for a hefty payment; the Pope ratified the contract. To fulfill their end, the Venetians built 50 warships and 450 transports. When, however, the crusaders proved unable to pay the agreed sum, rather than lose the investment, Dandolo waived the fee and joined the Fourth Crusade as one of its leaders. As compensation, the Doge demanded that the crusading force help Venice retake the town of Zara, then in revolt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the fall of Zara, Dandolo supported the diversion of the crusade from Egypt to Constantinople. There the Catholic leaders sought to place Alexis Angelus on the Byzantine throne, thereby gaining Byzantine support for their invasion of the Holy Land. This eventually led to the brief siege, capture and sack of Constantinople. In spite of his age, Dandolo took an active role in the planning and the operation, leading his Venetians against the sea walls of the great city, which fell to the crusaders in April 1204. Subsequently, Dandolo played the most central part in formulating the treaty partitioning the empire between the Byzantines and the crusaders (who sought to form a Catholic "Latin" empire), with Venice having significant rights in each.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Doge Dandolo joined the disastrous crusaders' invasion of pagan Bulgaria, but returned to the city and died of health complications in May 1205. He was buried in the Hagia Sophia, although the exact location of his tomb in the great church is unknown.</Text>

			<Text>Enrico Dandolo is today considered one of the greatest Venetian Doges. He took control of a mercantile power in decline, riven by corruption and inefficiency, challenged by great and small powers across the region. Trade had declined, and its military was moribund. By his death, he had ended all outside threats to Venice's influence, and made it the dominant power in Mediterranean trade again. Historians have referred to Dandolo as the "founder of the Venetian colonial empire." Venice itself would be prosperous, stable and secure for the next century.</Text>

			<Text>Gajah Mada (loosely translated as the "Elephant General"), hero to the people of Indonesia and symbol of national pride and patriotism, served as Prime Minister of the Majapahit Empire of Indonesia for the better part of the 14th Century AD. Although little information exists as to his early life and upbringing, it is known that he was born a commoner, rising to power based solely on his intellect and cunning - along with a renowned ferocity in battle. Serving as a royal bodyguard, Gajah Mada was instrumental in quashing a rebellion against his king, and was rewarded with a path to joining the ruling elite. Eventually rising to the position of Prime Minister, Gajah Mada led the Majapahit Empire to great success in conquering many of the neighboring island kingdoms, becoming the first to unite much of the territory that encompasses modern Indonesia.</Text>

			<Text>The earliest records of Gajah Mada's life begin in adulthood, when he is said to have served as commander of an elite guard unit entrusted with protecting the royal family of the Majapahit Emperor, Jayanagara (1309-1328 AD). During this period, a rogue Majapahit political officer known as Rakrian Kuti lead a rebellion against King Jayanagara. Learning of the plot, Gajah Mada safely escorted the king out of the capital city, which fell to Kuti's forces, and into hiding in the nearby city of Badander. Once the king was secure, legend has it that Gajah Mada spread rumors of the king's death to disrupt the rebellion, while organizing a group to retake the capital and reinstate the rightful king. Gajah Mada found that many of the military caste were dismayed by the king's supposed death and that Kuti was unpopular among the people. In the ensuing counter-insurrection, the upstart Kuti was killed, and Gajah Mada was rewarded for his efforts with his first leadership position within the ruling party.</Text>

			<Text>Some years later, according to legend, Gajah Mada's loyalty waned when the king took Mada's wife as a concubine. In the tale, Gajah Mada convince the court physician, a one-time supporter of Kuti, to kill the king when he fell ill; upon the king's death, Gajah Mada promptly had the physician arrested and executed. Whatever the truth in the tale, following the death of Jayanagara, his step-sister Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi ascended the throne with ambitions to expand the reach of her empire. Fortunately for Gajah Mada, his role in this expansion was considered integral by the new queen, and he was named mahapatih, Prime Minister, in 1329 AD. With sweeping powers and new authority, Gajah Mada set his sights on the far-flung reaches of the archipelago, vowing great things for the empire that entrusted him with its future. His famous oath, known as the Sumpha Palapa - often the subject of varying interpretations - declared in the most basic terms "I will not indulge in the fruits or spice, the earthly pleasures, until all of the known islands are conquered for the Majapahit."</Text>

			<Text>Following Gajah Mada's return in 1331 AD from suppressing a rebellion in Sadeng (eastern Java), it wasn't long before he launched his campaigns to conquer the neighboring islands of the Indonesian archipelago, beginning with Bali and Lombok in 1343. One by one he captured kingdoms and cities, states and provinces, all for the glory of his people. These included the Buddhist kingdom of Sriwijaya in Palembang and small kingdoms in West Sumatra, where Gajah Mada installed a Majapahit prince as a vassal ruler. The Elephant General then conquered Samudra Pasai in Sumatra, the first Muslim sultanate in Indonesia. Following this victory, in the span of two years Majapahit forces overran another half-dozen independent cities and kingdoms, including Temesek (now known as Singapore) across the straits.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tribhuwana abdicated the Majapahit throne in 1350 AD in favor of her son Hayam Wuruk, considered the greatest of the kings of the Majapahit. During his reign the empire reached its greatest extent, encompassing the whole of the Indonesian archipelago. Trade and the arts flourished under the king. The new king was content to leave the affairs of the nation to his prime minister, while he himself patronized the arts and sciences. With the tacit support of the king, Gajah Mada proceeded to add two dozen kingdoms to the empire, some as far away as modern-day Malaysia and the southern Philippines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Having conquered more than a dozen islands within the archipelago by 1357, Gajah Mada found himself in a difficult position, with one of the last remaining independent kingdoms being the Sunda in West Java. Although plans had been laid for the princess of the Sunda to marry the Hayam Wuruk, forming an alliance, Gajah Mada sought to press the Sunda further. By denying that the Sunda princess would become Queen Consort of Majapahit and instead be only a concubine, Gajah Mada enraged Sunda sensibilities. In meeting the wedding party at the town of Bubat, the negoiations degenerated into open hostility, and a skirmish ensued. Gajah Mada and his forces massacred the entire Sunda royal family and its bodyguard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The incident marred the legacy of Gajah Mada as his actions were seen as reckless and heavy-handed. Majapahit ministers and courtiers condemned him as bloodthirsty and brutal. The king stripped Gajah Mada of his titles, authority and honors. The once most-powerful man in the empire would spend the rest of his days in relative solitude at his remaining estate in East Java. Gajah Mada would die in relative obscurity in 1363 AD.</Text>

			<Text>Revered Swedish king and military commander Gustavus Adolphus, known most famously as "The Lion of the North," ascended to the throne at the age of 17 and quickly established his reputation as both a skilled military strategist and an innovator in the art of warfare. Inheriting a complex web of domestic and foreign conflicts from his father, the usurper King Charles IX, Adolphus wasted no time in forming alliances with the once hostile nobility, crushing the enemies of Sweden, and leading his nation to the upper echelon of power in Europe during the 17th century.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_GUSTAVUS_ADOLPHUS_TEXT_2">
			<Text>Much of the turmoil awaiting Adolphus upon his succession was the direct result of his father's brief reign as king. At the time of Adolphus's birth, his father was Duke Charles, serving as regent over Sweden in place of his nephew, King Sigismund of Poland.  While both King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Sigismund was also the rightful king of Sweden, son of the prior Swedish king, John III. However, by this point in history Sweden was a majority Protestant state, with Charles being a vocal Protestant himself, while Sigismund was a devout Catholic. Fearing the potential for Sweden's forcible return to Catholicism, a personal union between Sweden and Poland was formed instead. Sharing the same king - but independent of law and culture - this union allowed Duke Charles to lead as regent over Sweden while Sigismund remained in Poland, separating the opposing religious factions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As regent, Charles was seen as a protector of Protestant beliefs, and he used the increasing religious tension to his own advantage. Exerting his own authority over the regional governors in Sweden still loyal to the king, Charles incited a civil war with the followers of Sigismund. After a number of brief conflicts, the situation culminated at the Battle of Stangebro in 1598, when the invading army of Sigismund was soundly defeated.  Captured and returned to Poland, Sigismund was left with little support in Sweden. In 1600, the Riksdag, Sweden's parliamentary council, acknowledged that Sigismund had abdicated the throne and named Charles as King of Sweden.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The events leading up to Charles's coronation would have a lasting impact on the future reign of Adolphus. Not only was the personal union between Poland and Sweden broken, but Sigismund maintained his claim to the throne of Sweden, and refused to end his pursuit of the lost crown. As a result, a near constant state of war between the two nations followed for the next 50 years.</Text>

			<Text>While Charles is credited with protecting the Protestant beliefs of the Swedish people, his right to kingship was dubious at best. After leading Sweden for only seven years, Charles died in 1611, leaving his son to bear the burden of his tumultuous reign. Adolphus, who had already served with his father in the military during the prior years, was crowned king at age 17. Immediately after his ascension, he sought to quell the concerns of the Swedish nobility, whose involvement and authority in governing via the Riksdag had been reduced under Charles. According to the regulations of the parliament, Adolphus was too young to become king at 17. However, a compromise was reached, Adolphus became king, and in return he granted the nobility seats on his Privy Council, a collective of the king's closest advisors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Adolphus was faced with conflicts from three distinct rivals, with growing tension from Denmark and Russia coinciding with the ongoing feud involving Sigismund and Poland. With the potential for wars on three fronts, Adolphus quickly moved to ease some of Sweden's military engagements. The ongoing conflict with Poland and Sigismund was tenuously settled with a truce in 1611, a peace that was renewed each year while both sides dealt with turmoil elsewhere.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Kalmar Conflict was brought about by Sweden's attempts to claim the region of Finnmark in Norway, allowing Swedish traders to circumvent the Danish tax levied on those who passed through the strait connecting the Baltic and North Seas. Relying heavily on these taxes, and fearful of the Swedes developing an alternative trade route, the Danes declared war on Sweden in 1611. The Swedish effort was initially led by Charles, who died soon after and left Adolphus with little means to win the war. After two years of conflict, and the loss of several key Swedish fortresses, the war was finally settled in 1613 with the Peace of Knared. Although Sweden paid a hefty price to regain its lost fortresses, they managed to gain an exemption from any future tax when passing through the sound.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Ingrian War with Russia arose in 1610 from attempts by Charles to gain the throne of Russia for his other son, Charles Philip. Charles's death shortly after the start of the war left Adolphus to settle the conflict. Battles waged throughout Russia for seven years, with gains and losses for both sides countering any real progress. The war was concluded in 1617 with the signing of the Treaty of Stolbovo, whereupon Sweden gained several provinces, but also returned some of the territory acquired in conquest. Sweden also acknowledged Michael Romanov as the rightful Tsar of Russia as part of the agreement.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These early conflicts provided Adolphus with an opportunity to hone his skills as both king and commander. Learning the ways of diplomacy and warfare at an early age provided Adolphus with valuable experience, preparing him for the greater battles looming in his future.</Text>

			<Text>Per the agreement reached upon his succession, Adolphus granted increased authority to the Riksdag council, elevating its status from that of a ceremonial body to a governing council that could convene at its own behest and make decisions impacting national policy. As a result, Adolphus formed a close working relationship with Axel Oxenstierna, a noble who he named High Chancellor of the Privy Council. Through Oxenstierna's careful guidance, many of Adolphus's most notable domestic policies were formed. Among their most notable achievements, in 1617, the establishment of four clearly defined "estates" within the Riksdag - consisting of the nobility, the clergy, the burghers, and the peasantry - ensured that every member of Swedish society was given a stake and a voice on the national stage.</Text>

			<Text>Among the many names bestowed upon Gustavus Adolphus by his peers and historians alike, his reputation as "The Father of Modern Warfare" comes from the pioneering military tactics and weaponry developed during his reign. Numerous innovations still in use by modern armies were conceived of by Adolphus, including mobile light artillery, varied formations with mixed troop types, and aggressive offensive tactics that countered the formal defensive strategies employed during his time. Adolphus is notably credited as one of the earliest to equip his men with paper firearm cartridges, combining pre-measured amounts of gunpowder with the projectile in a paper cone. By eliminating the need to measure and pour gunpowder while in the field, Adolphus increased both the reliability and speed of his men's weapons.</Text>

			<Text>The heart of Adolphus's legacy was his ability to command on the battlefield, and he was something of a natural, learning the ways of war during his early teenage years while his father was still king. Adolphus was injured several times in battle, including a gunshot wound that left a musket ball entrenched near his neck. Never one to back down from his duties, Adolphus soldiered on with the wound, fighting in a number of battles while wearing only a flexible leather cuirass to ease the pain caused to him by wearing heavy iron armor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of the numerous battles fought by Sweden under his watchful eye, his most notable came during the Thirty Years War. Primarily a conflict between the Protestant states and the Catholic forces serving the Holy Roman Empire, the Thirty Years' War was a highly destructive conflict that left an indelible mark on Europe. Although a number of factors led to the outbreak of fighting in 1618, Sweden remained neutral until 1630, when Adolphus saw fit to aid the German Protestants and defend Sweden from the expanding ambitions of the Holy Roman Emperor. Led by Adolphus and his charge "Gott Mit Uns!" meaning "God is with us!" the armies of Sweden enjoyed a number of early successes, crushing the Catholic forces and stalling their advance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps his most famous confrontation, known as the Battle of Breitenfeld, was fought in 1631 in Saxony (present-day Germany). With effective use of mobile artillery, and a series of astutely timed maneuvers led by the Finnish light cavalry, the "Hakkapeliittas," Adolphus and his army crushed the Imperial forces, capturing the enemy artillery positions and using their own weapons against them. A complete and utter triumph for the united Protestant forces, the victory at Breitenfeld cemented Adolphus's reputation as an able leader and dangerous foe to the Holy Roman Empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shortly thereafter at the Battle of Lech in Bavaria in 1632, Adolphus led an army of 40,000 Swedish troops against a smaller contingent of Catholic forces led by Count Johan Tzerclaes. Under the cover of mobile artillery support, Adolphus sent his Hakkapeliitta across the river Lech using temporary bridges. Once across, the elite cavalry units dug in and created a defensive position allowing the remainder of the army to cross. Adolphus quickly led a charge against the Catholic forces and Tzerclaes was wounded, later dying of his injuries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Adolphus's final battle would come at Lutzen, Germany, late in 1632, when he was separated from his men while leading a charge through dense smoke, and was killed by gunfire. Bewildered by the loss of their great king, the Swedish ranks were soon in chaos, yet somehow still managed to force the Imperial army's retreat. Although Sweden suffered several defeats following Adolphus's death, by the signing of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, Sweden had emerged as one of the strongest nations in Europe, due in no small part to Gustavus Adolphus's brilliant leadership.</Text>

Incapacitated by her growing madness, Maria I died in Rio de Janeiro in 1816.</Text>

			<Text>Maria, raised and educated at court with her 3 younger sisters, devoted her greatest attention to religion and theology. Enthralled by the ritual and clarity of faith, Maria spent long hours in prayer and devotions. Accounts by court visitors note that she was graceful although tall, with sharp features but a warm smile. However, as early as her teens, she suffered from bouts of melancholy and nervous agitation, which occasionally confined her to her bed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Maria grew to adulthood, she wed Pedro III, the younger brother of her father. Despite their age difference - Maria was 25 and Pedro 42 at the time of their wedding - the marriage was stable and happy. Both were very pious, attending mass several times a day together. Pedro had his palace at Queluz torn down and constructed a new one in the style of Versailles, which Maria admired; the couple took up residence there in 1764 AD. Maria would over the years give birth to seven children, although only three survived to adulthood.</Text>

			<Text>In 1776 AD, the king Jose I suffered a stroke, dying in February 1777. Following the earthquake and tidal wave that had devastated Lisbon and Portugal's coast in 1755, and an assassination attempt in 1778, Jose had increasingly left the governing of the nation in the ruthless hands of his secretary of state, the Marquess of Pombal, who's methods of reform were brutal and came at the cost of civil liberties and personal freedoms. Maria's first act upon coming to the throne was to dismiss him from the government, primarily because of his unstinting anti-Jesuit policies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The next few years saw Portugal gradually embroiled in the affairs of Europe. In the face of the French Revolution an alliance with Great Britain was forged. In July 1782, Portugal joined the League of Armed Neutrality hoping to remain outside the spreading conflict of the Napoleonic Wars. Maria and her consort spent these years as patrons of the arts, especially interested in promoting religious works and in construction projects.</Text>

			<Text>The queen had long suffered from religious mania and melancholia, but her mental state was first acknowledged in early 1786 AD when she had to be carried back to her apartments in a fit of delirium after a religious ceremony. Her state worsened when later that year her husband died after a short illness, followed two years later by her eldest son, and her only surviving daughter Mariana. That same year, the queen's long-time confessor also passed away. The cumulative effect of these events was to topple Maria I into complete madness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1792, the council of ministers concluded that their queen was insane, and requested that her only surviving son, Joao, "assume the direction of public affairs." In 1799, he would take on the mantle of Prince Regent of Portugal as his mother was unfit to rule. Maria I was confined to the palace, occasionally roaming the corridors wailing "Ai Jesus" and calling for her dead husband and children.</Text>

Although Wellington would liberate Portugal in the Peninsula War, the royal family remained in Brazil for some years afterward.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maria herself spent most of her remaining life in the Carmo Convent in Rio de Janeiro. During the eight years there, she suffered increasingly from physical ailments, including dysentery and tropical fevers; arthritis and oedema confined her to a wheelchair, and eventually to her bed.

			<Text>During the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire and the powerful Habsburg Monarchy of Austria were led by the ever-persistent Maria Theresa, who defied the European powers opposed to her reign and bravely served the subjects of her kingdom. In nearly 650 years of Habsburg rule, Maria Theresa was the first and only female to ever lead the empire, and she proved to be among the most successful rulers in their history.</Text>

			<Text>Maria Theresa's rise to the Habsburg throne was fraught with controversy and turmoil from the onset. Her father, King Charles VI, had no sons, and as such had no rightful heir to the throne according to the existing laws of succession. In an effort to maintain his royal line and ensure that Theresa would rule as queen, Charles issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, declaring his intention to pass the crown on to his daughter. Although the edict was recognized for a time, following Charles's death in 1740 and Theresa's coronation, forces led by France and Prussia challenged her right to the throne and initiated the War of Austrian Succession. Backed by Great Britain, Theresa was adamant in her resistance to surrendering the throne or Austrian territory to her rivals. Unfortunately, her father had left the empire in an unstable position, with a depleted treasury making it impossible to bolster her undersized, poorly equipped military. After nearly eight years of fighting, during which time Austria suffered several crushing defeats and was forced to cede the mineral-rich territory of Silesia to Prussia, the Treaty of Aix-La-Chapelle finally ended the war. Although Theresa was now secure in her rule of the Habsburg dominion, Austria's rivalry with Prussia was only in its infancy, with a greater fight still to come.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_MARIA_TEXT_3">
			<Text>Traditionally, the ruler of the Austrian Habsburg domain was also the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire, a designation bestowed by the Pope. However, as was the case with her ascension to the Habsburg throne, laws of the time dictated that a woman could not be elected Holy Roman Empress. To circumvent this regulation, Maria Theresa named her husband, Francis Steven, as co-ruler of her lands in Austria and Hungary, allowing him to be named Holy Roman Emperor and she his empress consort. Although this relationship as a consort would normally imply a lesser position of authority, Francis Steven bowed to the wisdom and guidance of Maria Theresa, who handled all matters of rule personally.</Text>

			<Text>Renewed hostilities between Austria and Prussia led to the outbreak of the Seven Years War in 1756, with shifting alliances weighing heavily on the outcome. In an event known as the Diplomatic Revolution, Great Britain now allied with Prussia, while France shifted its allegiance to Austria. This reverse of alliances came about as national priorities shifted, with Britain viewing the powerful Kingdom of Prussia as the stronger ally against its traditional rival in France. The territory of Silesia was once again the primary focus of the conflict, with Maria Theresa desperately trying to regain the valuable region lost during the war for succession. Despite their best efforts, Austria again failed to reclaim Silesia, with the Treaty of Hubertusburg in 1763 marking the end of the war and reaffirming Prussian control of the territory.</Text>

			<Text>Austria's coffers had long been depleted by the time Maria Theresa was crowned, her father having focused much of his energy on securing the Pragmatic Sanction rather than internal affairs of the state. As such, one of Maria's first objectives was to increase Austria's revenue stream through taxation and balanced expenditures. Taxing both the nobility and members of the clergy, who had been previously been exempt from taxation, Maria's efforts quickly improved the faltering economy of Austria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With economic security in place, Maria directed her Supreme Chancellor, Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz, to enlarge and modernize the army of Austria. Creating a standing army of over 100,000 men, Haugwitz developed training standards and codified military regulations to increase the professionalism of Austria's armed forces.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maria is also known for strict educational reforms, enacted by force, requiring all children between the ages of six and twelve to attend school, regardless of gender or upbringing.</Text>

			<Text>Commonly known as "Pacal the Great," the Mayan king K'inich Janaab' Pakal is perhaps the most renowned of all Mayan rulers. Ascending to the throne at the tender age of 12 and ruling for nearly 70 years thereafter, Pacal inherited the city-state of Palenque during a time of great turmoil. Although the historical details surrounding his reign are often hazy, Pacal is best known for reinvigorating the ravaged city, which had been sacked repeatedly during the rule of his predecessors. Leading a vast construction effort, Pacal oversaw the creation of immense and remarkably detailed structures throughout his domain. Most famously, Pacal's burial tomb, known as the Temple of Inscriptions, features an intricately carved history of the king's life presented in Mayan glyphs. With an astonishing number of well preserved inscriptions, the temple has given contemporary archaeologists crucial insight into the once lost history and culture of this great Mayan city.</Text>

			<Text>Pacal's mother, Lady Zac-Kuk, was one of few women to ever rule independently over a Mayan city-state. Typically the crown was only passed on to the son of a king, but in the absence of a suitable male heir, leadership was bestowed upon Lady Zac-Kuk, who asserted her right to the throne as the granddaughter of a past queen. Ruling for 3 years until Pacal came of age, this unusual deviation in the traditionally patriarchal society led directly to the later efforts of Pacal to legitimize his reign and the rule of his family line.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Pacal did take the throne in 615, the city of Palenque was in a tumultuous position, having been the target of frequent incursions from the neighboring kingdom of Calakmul in the preceding years. Making a clear statement to Palenque's rivals early in his reign, Pacal sent his own raiding parties against the Calakmul, capturing several of their leaders and sacrificing them in retribution for the attacks.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_PACAL_TEXT_3">
			<Text>With the intention of both returning Palenque to its former glory, and also establishing the legitimacy of his rule, Pacal initiated the construction of grand monuments throughout the city, with reliefs extolling the virtues of his family line. A number of impressive structures were built, including the Temple of the Count and the large central complex known simply as "The Palace," featuring a peculiar four-story tower unlike any seen throughout the Mayan realm. Yet, of the many edifices assembled during his reign, none surpassed the Temple of Inscriptions. Built to serve as Pacal's burial tomb, construction began on the stepped pyramid during the final years of his life and continued under his successor, Chan Bahlum II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Featuring intricate carvings and hieroglyphic text, the temple is best known for housing Pacal's ornate sarcophagus. First discovered by Mexican archeologists in 1952, the walls of Pacal's tomb in the lower level of the temple contain the longest set of Mayan glyphs ever found. Although still the subject of interpretation today, the glyphs appear to chronicle the events of Pacal's life leading up to his death and the ascension of his heir.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The sarcophagus itself features an elaborately detailed stone lid with glyphs representing the planets and several constellations. These celestial elements in particular have contributed to controversial theories regarding the involvement of extraterrestrials in the Mayan culture, similar to theories surrounding the ancient Egyptian pyramids. While most esteemed researchers believe the sarcophagus depicts Pacal's journey to the underworld, other sources interpret this imagery as Pacal at the controls of a spaceship preparing for launch. Inside the sarcophagus, archaeologists discovered the skeletal remains of Pacal, wearing a finely crafted jade mosaic in the form of a mask.</Text>

In his time as king, nearly 1000 structures were assembled in the city, requiring stones that weighed up to 15 tons. Although his past is still being uncovered today, we can say with certainty that his efforts to restore the kingdom of Palenque led to the assembly of some of the greatest monuments and art ever created by the Maya.</Text>

			<Text>Born in December 1825 AD in Rio de Janeiro to Pedro I and his Austrian wife Maria Leopoldina, Pedro would be the second and last emperor of Brazil, his reign spanning five decades. Pedro was raised and classically educated by a succession of governesses and guardians. With a grueling regime of daily studies, great care was taken to foster ethical values and a personality quite different from the impulsive and irresponsible character of his father. Being the only male child of Pedro I to survive infancy, he was acclaimed Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil on the day of his father's abdication in 1831, although he did not assume his throne until he came of age at 14 in July 1840.</Text>

			<Text>During his reign, Pedro II would preside over 36 different cabinets, most of which had broad public support. Either directly or through his government, Pedro sponsored the construction of Brazil's first paved road, the "Unido e Industria" linking Rio de Janeiro to Juiz de Fora; the first steam railroad running from Santos to Sao Paulo; the first telephone service in 1877; participation in the laying of the first Brazil-Europe submarine telegraph cable; and the issuing of Brazil's first postal stamp.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Foreign relations were not as positive, as several nations became concerned by Brazil's economic growth and political clout. Two minor incidents led to the British issuing an order to the Royal Navy to seize Brazilian merchant ships as indemnity. Pedro responded by mobilizing his military, causing the British to softened their stance and propose a peaceful settlement in 1863. Almost immediately thereafter a year-long undeclared war with Uruguay - ended with the Brazilian occupation of the towns of Salto and Paisandu - demanded Pedro's attention. No sooner was this conflict settled than Paraguay invaded, which resulted in an unconditional Brazilian victory. A conflict with the Catholic Church (1872-1875) was resolved through negotiation, but left Pedro bereft of the clergy's support.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nonetheless, the diplomatic victory over Great Britain and the military victories over Uruguay and Paraguay had made Pedro II more popular than ever among the people. He now sought to leverage this popularity into his most enduring legacy - emancipation for the slaves in Brazil. The emperor viewed slavery as the last great obstacle to taking Brazil into the "modern age." Starting in 1871, Pedro oversaw a series of laws that resulted in some 700 thousand slaves freed, but no provision had been made to compensate the owners. The latter issue, which eroded support for the monarchy among the wealthy and gentry classes, proved Pedro's ultimate undoing.</Text>

			<Text>Secure in his people's affections, Pedro proceeded to indulge his life-long desire to travel. Distracted by these long absences, Pedro found himself increasingly removed from those segments of Brazilian society that he had fostered, named the emerging urban middle class and a new generation of liberal-minded students. Too, he no longer had the unwavering support of the clergy, the upper classes and the military. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although still beloved by the commoners, in November 1889 a non-violent military coup forced him to abdicate in favor of a republic. Aged and ailing, Dom Pedro was forced into exile in Europe, where he died two years later in Paris. France accorded him a royal funeral; in 1925 his remains were returned to Brazil, where he was interred in the cathedral in Petropolis he helped found.</Text>

			<Text>Inheriting an empire on the brink of disintegration, Pedro turned Brazil into an emerging power in a changing world, the "other great power of the Americas." The nation came to be distinguished from its neighbors in South America due to its political stability, freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economy and rich culture. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment was the peaceful abolition of slavery in Brazil, despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, Pedro II was a vigorous sponsor of education, the arts and the sciences in Brazil. Overthrown while still highly regarded by his people and at the height of his popularity, he is honored by many Brazilians as a hero, as a national symbol, as the "Father of the People" personified.</Text>

At the time that Brigham Young led the first Mormon settles into Utah in 1847 AD, Pocatello had been elevated to chief among the Shoshone. Young followed a policy of appeasement and conciliation with Pocatello, who expressed his concerns over the destruction of game and grass lands by the emigrant farmers. Pocatello became increasingly concerned by the migration and movement of whites into and through Shoshone lands, especially in the wake of the discovery of gold in California and Montana.</Text>

			<Text>Raids on wagon trains and isolated farms, as well as the theft of horses and cattle, increased dramatically in the late 1850s. Whether due to rogue natives, white outlaws or restless young Shoshone, Pocatello was soon being blamed for every attack. Over the next few years, white settlers and natives engaged in a number of clashes and murders. The intermittent hostilities culminated in August 1862 when Pocatello himself led an attack on a wagon train moving through the City of Rocks in south-central Idaho. A few days later, Shoshone war bands attacked two other wagon trains near the Snake River.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Concerned about the security of overland routes to the west coast as the Civil War progressed, the Lincoln administration ordered Colonel Patrick Connor and his Third California Volunteer Infantry Regiment into Utah to quell the unrest, where they established Camp Douglas three miles east of Salt Lake City. Additional raids by Chief Bear Hunter of the Great Basin Shoshone spurred Connor, along with the Second Regiment California Volunteers Cavalry, to move against the winter encampment in Cache Valley where several Shoshone tribes, including Pocatello's, had gathered. Aware of the approaching white troops, as other chiefs prepared their warriors to fight, Pocatello decided to lead his away. In the process, he avoided the Bear River Massacre, which resulted in approximately 500 Shoshone men, women and children killed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The U.S. Army continued with the pacification program, roaming the area seeking to arrest the remaining Shoshone chiefs, especially Pocatello. Avoiding capture for nearly five years, eventually Pocatello's band was forced to surrender due to illness and starvation. At the Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868, Pocatello agreed to forfeit two-thirds of his Shoshone hunting grounds, to permit transit of their lands by whites, and to relocate to the Fort Hall Indian Reservation on the Snake River; for their part, the U.S. government pledged to supply $5000 worth of food and supplies annually.</Text>

			<Text>As was far too common, the U.S. Indian Bureau failed to keep its promises; food supplies usually arrived spoiled, the promised cash annuities were rarely paid, and the land was unsuitable for farming. In the years following their confinement, the natives suffered severely from disease and hunger. In 1875, after a particularly poor growing season, Pocatello led his tribe off the reservation to a Mormon missionary farm near Corinne, Utah, helping to plant and maintain wheat, corn, potatoes and garden vegetables, all of which thrived. Pocatello hoped that mass conversion of his people to Mormonism would avoid starvation. White settlers in the area, however, were less obliging and called for their return to the reservation, through force if necessary. When the U.S. Army threatened hostilities, Pocatello led his tribe back to the reservation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Feeling betrayed yet again, Pocatello and most of the Shoshone rejected Christianity. The old chief, now in his 60s, grew increasingly discontented and withdrew from reservation affairs. Pocatello's health declined precipitously, and he died in 1884. At the request of his tribe, Pocatello was interred dressed in full war attire in a deep spring near the Snake River, along with his best clothing, knives, guns and 18 of his horses.</Text>

			<Text>As many Native American leaders did, Pocatello struggled to come to terms with the influx of whites. On the one hand, he sought to co-exist with them; on the other, he was determined to protect his people's rights and freedom. Despite being fearless and cunning, in the end all Pocatello could do was bow to the inevitable, leading his surviving people onto a reservation. Although unsuccessful in his efforts to keep his people free to roam their tribal homeland, he is greatly respected by the Shoshone for preserving their cultural heritage. His legacy is reflected in the number of geographic and man-made (not the least of which is Pocatello, Idaho) features named for him - ironically, mostly by whites.</Text>

			<Text>Known as the "Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah," "King of Kings," and "Elect of God," Haile Selassie ruled Ethiopia as emperor for nearly 40 years in the 20th century. Born as Lij Tafari Makonnen in 1892, the man who came to be known as Haile Selassie spent his life serving the interests of Ethiopia and bringing his nation to the forefront of African politics. Best known for reforming the ancient feudal practices of Ethiopia through his attempts at modernizing the nation, Haile Selassie worked tirelessly to gain international recognition for Ethiopia on the world stage. His legacy in global politics has been surpassed only by his role as the messiah of the Rastafari religion, among whose followers he is venerated as the god who will lead the Rastas back to their homeland of Ethiopia.</Text>

			<Text>As the son of a provincial governor, Haile Selassie spent his formative years under the tutelage of several mentors selected by his father, including an influential monk named Abba Samuel. As his education continued, Selassie was seen fit to rule as governor of several minor provinces, and by age 17, had already established himself as a rising political star. During his time as governor, Selassie emerged as a progressive thinker among his peers, introducing policies that reduced the feudal control of the nobles by increasing the authority of the central government.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1916, Haile Selassie was named Regent Plenipotentiary, serving under Empress Zewdito, placing him in the position of heir apparent to the throne. With both conservative and progressive supporters alike, Selassie was the ideal regent. However, over the course of his appointment, Selassie's support among the progressives throughout Ethiopia continued to grow, much to the chagrin of the conservative Empress. Although Empress Zewdito was the nominal leader of Ethiopia, as regent, Selassie handled much of the government's administration himself. During this period, Selassie is credited with ensuring Ethiopia's membership in the League of Nations, an inclusion that came about as a result of his efforts to abolish slavery in Ethiopia.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_SELASSIE_TEXT_3">
			<Text>As Haile Selassie's influence and popular support continued to climb, the Empress was forced to confront the would-be ruler. In 1928, Empress Zewdito attempted to remove Selassie from office by accusing him of treason, but her efforts found little backing. Selassie's popularity at this point was widespread, and he garnered a great deal of support from within the military, leaving Zewdito with little means to assert her claims. As a result of the confrontation, Zewdito was forced to name Haile Selassie King of Ethiopia, a title beneath her own, but still acknowledging his increasing authority within the nation. Less than two years later, the Empress died of unexplained causes, leaving the throne of Ethiopia vacant for Selassie to claim as his own. It was following his coronation as emperor in 1930 that he first came to use the name Haile Selassie, which meant "Power of the Trinity" in the Amharic language used in Ethiopia. Soon after taking the throne, Selassie was instrumental in the creation of the first written constitution of Ethiopia, a task he would later mention in his autobiography as having planned since his time as regent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1935, the Italian regime led by Benito Mussolini declared war on Ethiopia, invading in the fall. This conflict came to be known as the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (the first having occurred in the late 1800s). After brief fighting between the Italian and Ethiopian forces, including several battles led by Selassie himself, Italy succeeded in occupying and eventually annexing the African nation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With Italy's successful campaign against Ethiopia, Haile Selassie was forced into exile, but not before pleading the case for Ethiopia's defense at the League of Nations. Despite his galvanizing speech that railed against the Fascist movement of Italy, his plea fell on deaf ears, and Selassie was left to bide his time. He would spend the next five years residing in England, where he continued to speak out against the Italian occupation and attempted to garner support from the international community for a movement to reclaim his country.</Text>

			<Text>With the outbreak of World War II, in 1939, efforts were finally undertaken to liberate Ethiopia from the Italian regime, spearheaded by the British during the East African Campaign. Joined by selected units of the Ethiopian military, this liberation army came to be known as the Gideon Force and was instrumental in the fight to retake the Ethiopian homeland. By 1942, the Italians had surrendered and were forced to acknowledge the renewed sovereignty of Ethiopia, with Haile Selassie returning to the capital city of Addis Ababa. Having found little solidarity in the League of Nations, Selassie became a major proponent of the United Nations, with its increased provisions for international security, and secured Ethiopia's position as a founding member in 1948.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_SELASSIE_TEXT_5">
			<Text>Over the following years, Selassie continued his quest to modernize Ethiopia through reform while also improving his nation's foreign affairs and international recognition. In the 1960s Selassie led the Organization of African Unity, predecessor to the modern African Union. With the goal of creating solidarity between the independent states of the African continent, Selassie believed that a unified voice would strengthen the people of Africa. Although Selassie tried to establish the organization as more than just an ideological entity, the organization was left with little authority or actual power without the backing of a military force.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While working with the international community, Selassie was also focused on improving the welfare of his people at home. Although his efforts to break the nobility's hold on land ownership were met with limited success, the initiative sparked a movement that carried on past his reign. Reforms were also made to provide greater access to educational facilities, while economic programs ensured a just system of taxation. Despite the goodwill generated by these domestic programs, Selassie's efforts to increase his own authority through modifications to the constitution resulted in an increasingly visible dissident movement.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Late in the 1960s, Marxist ideologies took root in Ethiopia, and as the people suffered through a famine and drought in the early 1970s, Selassie's popularity dwindled. An economic crisis that led to soaring inflation would be the final straw, as Selassie tenuously maintained his position until 1974, when he was deposed and arrested by a Marxist military group known as The Derg.</Text>

			<Text>"Strike an enemy once and for all. Let him cease to exist as a tribe, or he will live to fly at your throat again." According to the diary of H.F. Flynn, Shaka voiced this edict to his ally Dingiswayo concerning a defeated enemy; even if apocryphal, these words certainly summarize Shaka's philosophy. Bastard son of a tribal chieftain, Shaka kaSenzangahona would oust his half-brother in 1816 AD to claim leadership of the Zulus. He is credited with unifying the Nguni tribes into the Zulu Kingdom. Although called a military genius for his reforms and innovations, he has also been condemned for the brutality of his reign. Whatever the judgment, Shaka laid the foundation for an imposing Zulu state. Upon his assassination in 1828, the Zulu were poised to challenge even the Europeans for control of southern Africa.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_SHAKA_TEXT_2">
			<Text>Although Shaka's life is shrouded in legend and lies, we do know he was the illegitimate son of Senzangahona, chief of the insignificant Zulu tribe, which numbered less than 1500 people. Shaka's mother, Nandi, was the daughter of a deceased chieftain of the Langeni. Despite his attempts to deny paternity, Senzangahona would eventually marry Nandi, installing her as his third wife. But the relationship was troubled, and the Zulu chiefain would exile Nandi and Shaka. The two wandered until 1803 AD, when they found haven with the Mtetwa and their chief Dingiswayo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Under Dingiswayo's patronage, Shaka grew into a tall, imposing young warrior, imbued with courage and daring. At the age of 23, Shaka was given command of a regiment in Dingiswayo's army. His deeds and stature brought him a rapid rise in the army, and Shaka became one of the chieftain's foremost commanders. Shaka rearmed his units, discarding the light throwing spear the Mtetwa favored for a broad-bladed stabbing spear (the famed assagai) and a large, cowhide covered shield.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the death of Shaka's father around 1816 AD, Dingiswayo lent his protege the military support necessary to oust and assassinate his half-brother Sigujana and establish himself chieftain of the Zulu. The coup was relatively bloodless, and the Zulu accepted Shaka without reservation. Shaka pledged himself a vassal of the Mtetwa. As the chieftain's favorite, Shaka was granted unusual latitude in expanding his holdings through conquering and assimilating neighboring tribes. By 1817, Shaka could command a force of 2000 warriors, and had assured his position as the first among Dingiswayo's vassals.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_SHAKA_TEXT_3">
			<Text>According to legend, in Dingiswayo's last battle against Zwide of the Ndwandwe, Shaka purposely delayed the arrival of his forces until Dingiswayo had been defeated and killed, keeping his own forces intact. Stepping into the power vacuum, Shaka began conquering and assimilating small neighboring tribes with brutal efficiency. Within a few years the Qwabe, Hlubi and Mkhize were added to the Zulu empire; through diplomacy and patronage, Shaka brought the Sithole and Thuli under his command. By 1824, Shaka had an army of 20,000 warriors, trained in his manner of tactics and strategy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Concerned by the growing Zulu power, Zwide moved against Shaka. The first Ndwandwe invasion was defeated at Gqokoli Hill by superior tactics and Shaka's defensive strategy. In 1819 AD, Zwide sent a second expedition into the Zulu lands. Retreating steadily, Shaka lured the massed enemy deep into his own territory, until, at the Mhlathuze River, Shaka flung his regiments at the exhausted Ndwandwe and their allies. The outcome was a decisive defeat for the invaders in a two-day running battle, and the Ndwandwe, Jere, Maseko and Msene tribes were virtually annihilated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By the time the first white traders reached the southeastern African coast in 1824, Shaka was in control of an empire which spanned the entire coast and reached far inland. Shaka accorded the white traders favored treatment, ceded them land, and allowed the building of a trading post at Port Natal. Alert to the trade advantages, curious about their technology and culture, Shaka insured there were no serious conflicts between the Zulu and the Europeans.</Text>

			<Text>By 1828, Shaka was an undisputed despot; but his frequent cruelties and unstable behavior was eroding the loyalties of his people. With the death of his mother in October 1827, Shaka dispatched his royal regiments to force the surrounding tribal chieftains to grieve. Taking advantage of the absence of his loyal troops, in September 1828 his personal bodyguard Mbopha and his half-brothers Dingane and Mhlangana stabbed Shaka to death near the Ikanda at Dukuza. Shaka's body was dumped into an empty grain pit, which was then filled with rocks and mud; the exact site has never been conclusively identified.</Text>

			<Text>Theodora, wife of Justinian I and Empress of the Byzantine Empire, ruled one of history's preeminent empires during the 1st millennium AD. Known today as the most influential woman of the Byzantine Empire, Emperor Justinian named Theodora co-ruler of the empire, trusting in her wise counsel to guide his reign. Rising from humble beginnings, Theodora would become known throughout the empire - and history - as a tactful, trusted advisor to her emperor. She would be so crucial to the progress of the empire that some think it was Theodora, not Emperor Justinian, who truly guided the people of Byzantium during her lifetime.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_THEODORA_TEXT_2">
			<Text>Most of our knowledge of Theodora comes from the writings of noted Byzantine historian Procopius of Caesarea, who extensively documented the life and times of the Byzantine Empire during Theodora's reign in the 6th century. Theodora's early life as we know it was a colorful one, her father having been a bear-keeper at the Hippodrome, her mother an acrobat. Said to have had exceptional intelligence and wit, Theodora supported herself independently as an actress for some time before catching the eye of Justinian, then heir to the throne of his uncle, Justin I.</Text>

			<Text>As mistress to Justinian, Theodora's beauty and intelligence made such an impression that he elevated her to the rank of patrician, where she joined the aristocratic families of the empire. Although Byzantine law prevented members of the government from marrying entertainers such as Theodora, Justinian's devotion to her was apparently enough that he had the law repealed. In 525, Justinian and Theodora were married, and shortly after his ascension to the throne as Emperor in 527, Theodora became "Augusta," or Empress of the Byzantine Empire.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_THEODORA_TEXT_4">
			<Text>Theodora was no ordinary consort to the Emperor; Justinian ensured that she was named co-ruler, an important distinction that provided her with a much greater role in political affairs. During her reign, she was influential in the institution of numerous progressive (even by modern standards) policies. Theodora is credited with pressing Justinian to increase the rights of women within the empire, not only expanding their right to property ownership, but also reforming divorce laws that previously favored men.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_THEODORA_TEXT_5">
			<Text>Theodora was what is known as a "Monophysite Christian," meaning she believed that Jesus Christ was an entirely divine being, unlike the more prevalent Orthodox belief that Jesus had a dual nature (divine yet with an earthly body). This ideology was highly controversial at the time, and considered divisive and heretical by many members of the Orthodox Church. Despite Justinian's Orthodox beliefs, Theodora maintained her own independence as a Monophysite, and even sheltered the Monophysite leaders who were often oppressed by the Orthodox majority. Theodora is also known to have founded a Monophysite monastery in the city of Sycae near Constantinople.</Text>

			<Text>The fortitude of Theodora and Justinian would be tested during the Nika Revolt, an uprising led by two opposing political factions (the Greens and the Blues), who attempted to install a rival Emperor to usurp Justinian's power. As the story goes, Justinian's natural instinct was to flee the city, but Theodora encouraged him to stand fast. Imploring Justinian to remain in the city, Theodora argued that it was better to die as an Emperor than as a fugitive. Believing in the wisdom of Theodora's words, Justinian remained in Constantinople and ordered his most loyal general, Flavius Belisarius, to attack the rebels. Herding the dissidents into the Hippodrome, Belisarius and his men annihilated them, brutally killing thousands, and quashing the rebellion.</Text>

			<Text>Widely considered both founder and liberator of the Netherlands, William, Prince of Orange, also known as "William the Silent," led a successful rebellion in the mid-16th century against the Spanish Habsburg Dynasty who held dominion over the Dutch Low Countries. Once the loyal servant of King Philip II of Spain, William eventually became the most prominent leader of the rebellion, as his growing distaste for the continued Spanish persecution of Dutch Protestants came to a head. Rallying his fellow noblemen to the cause, William became an outlaw in the eyes of the Spanish monarch and led the Dutch forces in a number of successful battles against the king before falling to an assassin's bullet in 1584.</Text>

			<Text>Born to Count William of Nassau in 1533, William inherited the title of Prince of Orange at age 11 when his cousin Rene, then prince, died without an heir to his title and land holdings. During this period the Netherlands were controlled by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who ruled as leader of the Habsburg Monarchy, while also serving as king of Spain. While receiving all of the education and training expected of a nobleman, William later became a favored member of the Emperor's court. The emperor's connection to the Spanish crown would play an important role in William's future efforts to wrest control of the Netherlands from Spain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Promoted through the ranks of the military, by his early twenties, William was already a commander in the Imperial army, while also holding various diplomatic posts as an advisor to the Emperor. However, William's favor with the Emperor came at the price of his faith, as his Lutheran upbringing was abandoned in favor of Roman Catholicism to facilitate his rise to power.</Text>

			<Text>In 1555, Charles relinquished the crown of Spain to his son, Philip II. Philip was known for his ruthless disregard for the lives of the Protestants under his rule, showing little empathy for their beliefs and expanding the powers of the Inquisition against the Reformation. In serving his new king, William began to understand the true intentions of Philip, who had no qualms about wiping out the Protestants by whatever means necessary. Although William adopted Catholicism as part of his education, he was raised a Lutheran, and still firmly believed in the right of the people to follow their own beliefs. As the story goes, William overheard a conversation between Philip and King Henry II of France while on a hunting expedition, discussing the future extermination of the Protestants in both of their kingdoms. This event is said to have sparked William's decision to oppose Philip and Spanish control of the Netherlands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In attempting to subdue the established Protestants in the Netherlands and drive them into exile or worse, Philip devised a system of "placards." These placards served as edicts making the practice of Lutheran and Calvinist beliefs an offense punishable by torture and death. So extreme was the persecution that many Dutch Catholics joined the Protestants in opposing Philip's policies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]William began to openly criticize the king in public, making his opinions on the matter clear, and encouraging others to stand up to repressive policies of Philip. In 1566, the Compromise of Nobles, a collective of noblemen from the Netherlands, petitioned the Spanish regent Margaret of Parma to end the persecution of Protestants within the Netherlands. Despite their efforts for a peaceful resolution, Philip rejected the forwarded petition, and in response, iconoclasm spread throughout the Dutch territory, leading to the destruction of Catholic icons across the country by Protestant rebels.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_WILLIAM_TEXT_4">
			<Text>As iconoclasm spread along with increasingly public displays of forbidden Protestant worship, Philip sent the Duke of Alba, Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, known as the "Iron Duke," to the Netherlands to quash the uprising and deal with the rebels. Upon his arrival, the duke established the Council of Troubles, later known among the Protestants as "The Council of Blood," to oversee the trial and punishment of the rebels and their leadership. Many of those summoned to the council went into hiding, including William himself, but some 1000 or more Protestants are said to have been tried and executed at the hands of the Iron Duke.</Text>

			<Text>While funding the uprising from his home in Nassau, William and the rebels established several armies to attack the Spanish on multiple fronts. The group of Protestant exiles and Dutch noblemen resisting the Spanish came to be known as the "Geuzen," or "Beggars," with the most prominent force being the "Watergeuzen" - the Sea Beggars. William used his wealth to fund the Sea Beggars and equip their vessels, which they used to raid coastal cities throughout the Netherlands, acting as privateers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]William's brother, Louis of Nassau, led an army of mercenaries and French Huguenots (French Protestants) against a Spanish force under the command of Jean de Ligne, himself a Dutch nobleman still loyal to Philip. Meeting at the Battle of Heiligerlee in the northern Dutch province of Groningen in 1568, Louis routed the Spanish army and Jean de Ligne was killed. Unfortunately, William and Louis' second brother, Adolph, was also killed while leading the Dutch cavalry. This historic battle is considered by historians to mark the onset of the Eighty Years' War, as the great conflict for Dutch independence came to be known.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the Battle of Jemmingen shortly thereafter, Louis's army was crushed by the Spanish forces while attempting to seize the city of Groningen itself, forcing his retreat. William himself took up the charge and led an army of Dutch forces to several victories, inspiring the Dutch people as more and more cities throughout the Netherlands were wrested from Spanish control. Despite the Dutch gains, capturing and controlling much of the northern territory over the next decade, the Spanish continued to maintain a firm grasp on the southern Netherlands.</Text>

			<Text>In 1573, the Union of Utrecht was signed in the northern Dutch city bearing the document's name, uniting the Northern provinces in opposition of Spain. Although not yet fully independent, the union clearly marked a turning point in rejecting Spanish governance of the region. While Spain still controlled the southern territories, in 1581, the Act of Abjuration finally served as a formal declaration of the Low Countries' independence from Philip's rule. Unfortunately for William, he would not live to see the Netherlands free from the grasp of Spain in its entirety.</Text>

			<Text>With an ample hefty bounty placed on his head by King Philip, the first attempt on William's life soon followed, when the Spaniard Juan de Jauregui fired a shot at William in 1582, wounding him in the neck. Although William was gravely injured, he managed to survive his injuries, but his slow recovery limited his involvement in the rebellion. Less than two years later, William was again attacked by an assassin, this time by a French Roman Catholic named Balthasar Gerard. Attacking William at his home, Balthasar fired three shots, the fatal blow striking William in the chest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the coming days, Balthasar was tried and sentenced to death. His punishment was torture, which took place over the span of an entire week. Balthasar's only relief came when he was eventually beheaded.</Text>

			<Text>William is revered today as both the founder of the Dutch independence movement and the sovereign nation as it stands today. Inspiring the people of the Netherlands to rise up against Spanish rule and the abuses suffered by the Dutch Protestants, William gave his life in pursuit of an enlightened view point that deemed it only fair that all men be allowed to follow their beliefs.</Text>

These ocean-going ironclads were so revolutionary for their time, equipped with 100-ton rifled muzzle loaders and with 50mm armor plate, that the British scrapped their planned new class of battleship to design a counter to the Italian ships. Although the Caio Duilia and Enrico Dandolo never saw action and were scrapped in 1909 and 1920 respectively, they were deployed to the Mediterranean coast of Africa several times to protect or promote Italian interests.</Text>

			<Text>The seax is a large knife or short, curved sword with a notched blade and favored by many warriors of Celtic and Frankish tribes. Equally useful as both a tool and a weapon, the seax was particularly effective in close-range, melee combat. Over the decades of the barbarian migrations, various versions were developed, including the schmalsax (narrow seax) and the breitsax (broad seax) as well as long and short versions of each. In the epic poem Beowulf, the hero uses a seax to chop apart a dragon and Grendel's mother uses one when fighting Beowulf.</Text>

Generally armed with thrusting spears, throwing spears and shields, although some had swords and bows, these unarmored levies were particularly effective in melee in rough terrain where the rigid military formations the Romans favored proved unwieldy. Commonly organized in hundafabs, literally "hundred armed men," along tribal lines, the Gadrauhts were unreliable in pitched battle, as likely to fight to the last man as to flee when the tide turned against them.</Text>

Unevenly armed and equipped, led by tribal chieftains, the dervish cavalry were marked by their fanaticism, making them fearsome opponents willing to take losses that would deter other units. Until 1920, when the Mullah was finally defeated, his most effective commanders were among the Dervish cavalry.</Text>

A variant of the francisca, a light-weight axe developed by the Franks in the 3rd Century AD, the Vandal version was thrown with an overhand motion that caused the axe to rotate in flight and so increased accuracy. Heavier than arrows and more accurate than spears, the throwing axe proved even more effective in naval combat after the Vandals conquered Roman Carthage.</Text>

			<Text>The Confederate States of America, also known as the Confederacy, was the name chosen by the southern states that opted to secede from the U.S. following Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency in 1860. Viewing Lincoln's perspectives on slavery as leading to an infringement upon the individual rights of each state, including their right to break from the constitution and secede, the southern states did just that.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, sought to directly oversee not only the logistical issues of the war effort, but also the military strategies and appointments of the southern armies (much like his counterpart in the North). The Confederacy was faced with war against an opponent armed with superior equipment, greater manpower, and more raw materials dedicated to the conflict. These concerns did little to hamper the southern forces' enthusiasm for the fight ahead, as they viewed this as a battle for their way of life and the individual rights of every state versus the federal government.</Text>

The Union was led by President Abraham Lincoln, who oversaw both the logistical and tactical aspects of the war against the South.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]From the onset of the war, the Union states had vastly more resources and manpower available to fuel their efforts, with the North being much more industrialized than the South. The Union also had a much larger population from which to recruit soldiers, outnumbering the South nearly four to one. However, despite these advantages, the Union was still faced with a difficult task in reclaiming the southern states. The Confederate armies were led by skilled officers, and fighting to defend their home states gave the Confederates a distinct advantage in their knowledge of the terrain.</Text>

			<Text>Jefferson Davis, born in 1808, was an American politician and military officer elected to lead the Confederate States of America following the secession of southern states in 1861. After attending the United States Military Academy in West Point and serving at Fort Crawford, Davis moved to Mississippi where he operated a plantation. After serving briefly in the Mexican-American war, Jefferson Davis returned to Mississippi and was appointed by the governor to serve in the U.S. Senate in 1848. As a slave owner and military veteran, Davis was seen as the embodiment of southern values, a sentiment that would help him in his burgeoning political career.</Text>

			<Text>In 1853, Davis was appointed Secretary of War under newly elected president Franklin Peirce. After serving his term, he returned to the Senate in 1857, where he urged restraint against secessionist movements brewing in the southern states. However, following Lincoln's victory in the presidential election of 1860, Mississippi joined six other states in seceding from the union, and Davis resigned his senate seat to return home. Although Davis had only anticipated serving the newly formed Confederate States of America in a military leadership role, he was selected by acclamation to serve as provisional President of the Confederacy in 1861.</Text>

			<Text>As the Confederate President, Davis attempted to negotiate for the acquisition of several Union-held forts that remained within the new Confederate territory. President Lincoln had no interest in ceding any territory to the South, and sent orders for Fort Sumter in South Carolina to be resupplied with food and materials. Viewing this as an act of war, the Confederate troops under General P.G.T. Beauregard bombarded the fort - marking the beginning of the American Civil War.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVIL_WAR_SCENARIO_LEADERS_ELIZABETH_TEXT_4">
			<Text>Jefferson Davis took it upon himself to directly oversee many of the strategies employed by the Southern armies. He was quick to recognize that the Confederacy had limited resources and equipment in comparison to the larger Union army, and sought to rely on a staunch defense rather than an aggressive offensive approach. However, after this strategy proved successful in protecting the Confederate capital in Richmond, Virginia, Davis and his senior advisor, General Robert E. Lee, pressed forward with plans for an invasion of the North.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVIL_WAR_SCENARIO_LEADERS_ELIZABETH_TEXT_5">
			<Text>Despite General Lee's brilliance as a military tactician and leader, the Confederate campaign to invade the northern states was met with hard fighting at every turn. At the Battle of Antietam in September of 1862, the Confederates suffered over 10,000 casualties, and later still at the Battle of Gettysburg another 20,000 men or more were killed or wounded (an event widely considered the turning point of the war.)</Text>

Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia surrendered just days later, and Jefferson Davis and his Cabinet fled south. On May 5, 1865, the Confederate government was officially dissolved in Washington, Georgia.</Text>

			<Text>Born in 1809 in a small cabin in central Kentucky, Abraham Lincoln rose from seemingly humble beginnings to become one of the greatest statesmen in American history. In his early 20s, Lincoln served in a number of small government roles before his election to the Illinois General Assembly in 1834. In 1836 he began practicing law, and it wasn't long before he established a reputation as a savvy lawyer willing to take on a wide variety of cases. During successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives and later a single term in the U.S. House of Representatives, Lincoln became known for his views opposing the further spread of slavery in the United States, a key issue that became a hallmark of his political career.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVIL_WAR_SCENARIO_LEADERS_GEORGE_TEXT_2">
			<Text>In 1860, Lincoln successfully campaigned to become the 16th President of the United States. It was during the now famous Lincoln-Douglas debates that the specter of southern secession was first raised, when Lincoln continually rebuked the notion of allowing slavery to spread into the western territories of the United States. The southern states, united in their continued support for slavery, were prepared to abandon the United States if Lincoln were to be elected.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVIL_WAR_SCENARIO_LEADERS_GEORGE_TEXT_3">
			<Text>Soon after Lincoln's victory the first seven states to secede, led by South Carolina, and soon followed by Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, declared their sovereignty and formed the Confederate States of America in 1861. In naming Jefferson Davis as their president-elect, the southern states made good on their threat to secede, and it wasn't long before one of America's most devastating conflicts, the Civil War, began with a confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April of 1861.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVIL_WAR_SCENARIO_LEADERS_GEORGE_TEXT_4">
			<Text>Lincoln assumed command of the Union war effort as commander-in-chief, issuing unprecedented orders to imprison confederate sympathizers, blockade all confederate ports, and to seize and free any slave used in the confederate war effort. His most aggressive and noteworthy order, the Emancipation Proclamation, was signed on January 1st, 1863, and provided freedom to all slaves within the confederacy, although it did not grant them full citizenship within the United States.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVIL_WAR_SCENARIO_LEADERS_GEORGE_TEXT_5">
			<Text>Months later, Lincoln gave what would become one of the most famous speeches in history, the Gettysburg Address. His renowned opening line - "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal" - lives on today as one of the greatest reminders of Lincoln's mark on American history.</Text>

			<Text>Following nearly five years of warfare, during which time over 500,000 Americans fought and died, the Civil War ended with the surrender of General Robert E. Lee in April of 1865. Just five days later, while attending a play at Ford's Theater in Washington D.C., Lincoln was assassinated by the Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Although Lincoln did not survive to see the eventual outcome of his efforts to reestablish the nation and abolish slavery, the legacy of his deeds has long since established his position among America's greatest presidents.</Text>

On the Union side, following the Battle of Bull Run General McClellan appointed surgeon Charles Tipler the first medical director for the Army of the Potomac; in 1862 William Hammond was named Surgeon general of the United States and launched a number of reforms in the evacuation, treatment and recovery procedures for the wounded, including integrated field hospitals operating right at the front lines.</Text>

Once the spy arrives, there will be a period of time when they are "Establishing Surveillance" (noted in the "Activity" column). Once surveillance is established, your espionage options become available. Rigging an election, a passive ability, occurs every 15 turns while your spy is located within the City-State. If you are the only spy in the City-State, your influence will increase while everyone else's will drop. The presence of an enemy spy, especially one of a higher rank, can cause this mission to fail. No worries though, failing to rig an election is not dangerous to your spy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Staging a coup is more powerful than rigging an election, but also much riskier. A successful coup essentially allows you to "steal" the allied status from another civiization. To stage a coup, target a City-State that is allied with another player, and place your spy the same way you would with rigging an election. Once surveillance is established, you will have a new button available to you called "Coup". Clicking it will open a pop-up message that gives you your odds of success. The closer you are in influence to the target civilization, the greater your odds. The catch? If you fail, your spy is executed.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CONCEPT_RELIGION_SPREADING_RELIGION_SUMMARY">
			<Text>There are two ways that Religion spreads: The natural spread that the holy city as well as any other religious city generates and the deliberate actions a player can perform to convert other cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The natural spread of Religion is fairly straight-forward. Any city that has a majority Religion (more than half of their citizens are following a single Religion) exerts pressure up to 10 hexes from the city. If another city is within that range, and they do not yet have a majority religion, then the pressure will slowly start to convert citizens. If the city already has a majority religion, then it will take two or more cities exerting pressure to start converting citizens. The more cities exerting pressure on the target city, the faster a city's citizens will be converted. You can view your own outward religious pressure, as well as incoming pressure by mousing over the Religion icon on the city banner (if it already has a Pantheon or Religion).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To speed up the spread of your Religion the following options are available to you: You can purchase Missionaries by spending [ICON_PEACE] Faith in any city that already has the Religion you wish to spread as its majority. To purchase one just enter the city screen and you can open the purchase menu by clicking on the purchase button in the lower left. The Missionary will be grayed out if you don't have enough [ICON_PEACE] Faith to acquire it. Once you have a Missionary you can move him into or next to the city you wish to convert and click on the Spread Religion button in his action menu which will normally expend him after two uses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Great Prophets can spread Religion in a similar fashion but additionally they abolish any other Religions that might be present in their target city. They can perform this action multiple times before being expended.</Text>

Once the project receives enough production from civilizations, it is completed, and large rewards are distributed based on how much each civilization contributed. The highest level reward is always reserved for the civilization that contributed the most. There are also middle and bottom level rewards which are earned by meeting a certain threshold of contribution, depending on the project.

Once half of the civilizations in the game reach the next appropriate era (or one civilization reaches the era after that), a special session is held which temporarily puts normal session activity on hold. Depending on which era was reached, the number of delegates for civilizations and city-state allies may increase. The only resolution to decide during this special session is who the next host of the World Congress will be.

			<Text>In 293 AD Emperor Diocletian created a new administrative system for the unwieldy Roman Empire. He created a co-Augustus, selecting Maximian to oversee the eastern portion. Upon the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian, Constantine I formally divided the Roman holdings, and in 330 AD founded Constantinople as a "second Rome." So firmly established was the principle of two Romes that Theodosius I, upon his death in 395, bequeathed imperial rule to both his sons, Arcadius in the East and Honorius in the West. Theodosius the Great was the last to rule over an undivided empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eastern Rome, often termed the Byzantine Empire, encompassed the southern Balkans, all of Anatolia and Egypt, and much of the Levant. It was spared much of the upheaval and warfare that plagued Western Rome in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, due in large part to a succession of able emperors, a more established urban culture, and greater financial resources. The latter allowed the Byzantine emperors to placate barbarian invaders with tribute and hire mercenaries in large numbers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The riches and skills brought by extensive trade permitted Theodosius II to extend and further fortify the walls of Constantinople during the first decades of the 400s, making the city virtually impervious (the walls were not breached until 1204 AD). Byzantine wealth also allowed Theodosius to buy off Attila, deflecting him to the west. Theodosius's successor Marcian refused to pay the exorbitant annual tribute and the Hunnic Empire soon collapsed with Attila's death in 453. Indeed, many of the surviving Huns would serve as mercenaries in Eastern Rome's subsequent wars with the Sassanids and Arabs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the death of Attila, the eastern empire enjoyed a long period of peace and internal stability, while the western empire collapsed in invasion and chaos. The end of Rome in the west is generally dated in 476 AD when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustus. The Byzantine Emperor Zeno hired the Ostrogoths under their king Theodoric to reclaim the west. Theodoric led his forces into Italy and deposed Odoacer, establishing his own Kingdom of Italy. By urging the Ostrogoths to conquer Italy and Rome, and maintaining amiable relations with Theodoric, Zeno had both rid Eastern Rome of an unruly threat and gained nominal supremacy over Western Rome.</Text>

			<Text>The Franks were a tenuous confederation of Germanic tribes settled in a strip of land along the right bank of the Lower Rhine, the border of Rome in Germania. In the 3rd Century AD, some Franks raided Roman territories along the river, while others migrated into the empire and settled in Gaul. This brought a split in the Franks into the Ripuarian Franks (the first group) and the Salian Franks (the second).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Primarily a pastoral people, the Ripuarian Franks lived in small settlements and homesteads along the west bank of the Rhine, supporting themselves by fishing and hunting along with the occasional raid on Roman holdings. Beyond being an annoyance, the Ripuarians were among the most peaceful of Rome's neighbors. In 310 AD, the Emperor Constantine had a bridge built across the Rhine at Cologne to facilitate trade with them. The Ripuarians, given an impetus towards social unity by the Roman-administered city, were increasingly relied upon to provide protection for the empire, serving as a buffer against the more warlike tribes to the east. The last chieftain of the Ripuarian Franks, Sigobert the Lame, joined forces with Clovis I, who rallied the Franks against the Alemanni and reunited the Frankish tribes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Salian Franks meanwhile, displaced by the onslaught of barbarians from the north, migrated into the Roman territory of Toxandria (the region of modern-day Antwerp). This "insolent" settlement of Roman lands was rejected by Emperor Julian the Apostate, who attacked. In 358 AD, the Salians surrendered to Roman forces in exchange for citizenship. Under the emperor Honorius's patronage, the Salian Franks expanded their holdings considerably under Chlodio beginning in the 420. The Salians proved loyal friends of Rome. In 451, Flavius Aetius called upon his Germanic allies to fight off the invasion by Attila's Huns. The Salians fought alongside the Romans at the Battle of Chalons, which effectively ended the Hunnic threat to Western Europe. As a reward, the Romans allowed further Salian expansion. In 486, Clovis became absolute ruler of a mixed Roman-Germanic kingdom. He unified the Franks and defeated the Visigoths and Alemanni. Clovis established his new capital at Paris, laying the foundation for the nation of France.</Text>

			<Text>The Goths were an east European tribe of Scandinavian origins whose two branches, Visigoths and Ostrogoths, played a significant role in the fall of the Roman Empire. Although sharing common language, customs and beliefs, the Visigoths and Ostrogoths followed divergent paths and each founded a medieval kingdom.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Visigoths settled in Dacia, where they remained peacefully co-existing with the Romans until 376 AD, when their leader appealed to the Byzantine Emperor Valens to move his people south of the Danube to find refuge from the Huns. The treaty lasted until 395, the year that Alaric I took the Visigoth throne. In 408, Roman troops massacred the families of approximately 30,000 barbarian soldiers serving as mercenaries under Roman command. Alaric promptly declared war and invaded Italy, with Byzantine approval. After military victories and three sieges of Rome itself, Alaric's Visigoths captured the city in August 410. Rome was plundered and sacked, and Alaric set up a Visigoth kingdom in Italy. Over the next century, the Visigoths expanded their borders at a steady pace, eventually controlling southern Gaul and all of Iberia. With the capital at Toulouse, the Visigoths forced the Vandals from Iberia, but lost Italy. In 507 the Franks under Clovis decisively defeated the Visigoths at the Battle of Vouille and wrested control of Gaul from them. It was the beginning of a slow decline. The last king of the Visigoths, Roderic, was killed facing the Ummayad onslaught in 711 which marked the opening of the Muslim conquest of Iberia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The history of the Ostrogoths is somewhat less tangled. After the southern migration they established a vast but thinly populated kingdom between the Danube and Dneipr rivers. It was a multi-tribal empire, ruled by Gothic nobility and included Sarmatians, Gepids, Dacians as well as smaller Celtic and Slavic tribes. The rise of the Huns overwhelmed the polyglot kingdom, and the Ostrogoths accepted Hunnic rule and joined forces. The Ostrogoths were one of Attila's principle vassals fighting in Europe, as at the Battle of Chalons in 451 AD. But in revolt upon Attila's death, the Ostrogoths under Theodemir shattered the power of Attila's heirs at Nedao three years later. The year 454 also saw the birth of Theodoric the Great. In 471 he became king of the Ostrogoths. Within 20 years Theodoric ruled all of Italy, as well as much of the Balkans. But the weakness of the Ostrogoth rule quickly showed itself upon his death. The Byzantines took the offensive and forced the Ostrogoth king Totila to abandon Rome. In 553, at the Battle of Mons Lactarius, the remaining supporters of Totila were killed, captured or executed. The Ostrogoth remnants retreated and resettled in Austria. And the Ostrogoths disappeared from history.</Text>

			<Text>The last pre-Islamic Persian empire, the Sassanids ruled from 224 to 651 AD. Founded by Ardashir I, at its peak their empire encompassed all of modern Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, the Caucusus, parts of Arabia and Pakistan, the Persian Gulf and part of Turkey. It rivaled Rome and Byzantium in power and influence during its first golden age under Bahram V (421-438 AD) and his immediate successors. The empire endured until a series of Arab invasions toppled the last emperor Yazdegerd III.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Myth and conflicting historical accounts shroud the fall of the Parthian empire and the rise of the Sassanid empire. Sassanid rule appears to have begun in Istakhr, capital of the province of Persis under the governorship of Ardashir, reputed a descendant of a line of priests. In the general collapse of Parthian rule, the ruthless Ardashir murdered his rivals (including his brothers), declared himself Shahanshah ("King of Kings"), and quelled rebellions in neighboring provinces. His son Shapur I continued the expansion, overrunning Armenia, Bactria, much of the fledgling Kushan empire and even mounted several campaigns against Rome.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]From Shapur's death to Bahram V, the empire gradually grew to the east and south, although a series of inconclusive wars with Eastern Rome blocked Sassanid expansion to the west. Favoring more peaceful pursuits, Bahram V ushered in a golden age of literature, music, and sport. During the century following his death, however, his heirs were forced to spend their reigns fending off barbarian tribes, Byzantine and Arab invasions, and provincial revolts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A second Sassanid golden age began under Kavadh I (488-531 AD). But incessant warfare with Byzantium drained the treasury and weakened Sassanid authority in the western provinces. Nonetheless, Sassanid armies managed to capture Jerusalem (614 AD), Alexandria (619) and the rest of Egypt by 621. However, the sudden expansion overextended their military, an overtaxed populace grew restless, and religious fervor gripped the Muslims to the south. In three decades, by 651, the Sassanid Empire was no more, replaced by the Abbasid Caliphate.</Text>

			<Text>After decades of warfare along the borders and economic crises, in 293 AD Emperor Diocletian created a new administrative system for the Roman Empire. He created a dual emperorship, selecting Maximian to oversee the western portion. Upon the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian, in 330 Constantine the Great founded Constantinople as a "second Rome." Theodosius I was the last to rule over an undivided empire; upon his death in 395, he bequeathed imperial rule to both his sons, Arcadius in the East and Honorius in the West.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Compared to the Eastern Empire, Rome in the West was less populous, fragmented culturally and politically, its economy in a shambles due to heavy taxation to maintain its frontier, and beset by barbarians. In 402 AD its administrative capital was transferred to Ravenna, although the economic and cultural center remained Rome itself. Until the 4th Century, its military had concentrated in northern Gaul and along the Rhine, but increasingly military resources had to be diverted to secure Italy, which led to further revolts and civil wars in Britain, Gaul, north Africa and Germania.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In a cycle of usurpers and mediocre emperors following Honorius, central power eroded and Rome gradually lost control of its provinces. Roman institutions collapsed in regions of Iberia and Gaul as the migration of barbarian tribes such as the Goths and Vandals brought new client kingdoms into being. With the Vandal conquest of Africa, the empire lost control of the western Mediterranean, accelerating the decline of trade and, more significantly, the vital grain shipments to Italy. Meanwhile, the Huns were unified under Attila in 444 AD, who promptly invaded Western Rome, wreaking havoc until his death in 453.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the next 20 years Rome suffered a series of civil wars, culminating when the Germanic-born Roman general Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustus, the last emperor of Western Rome in 476 AD. Although the Emperor of the East Zeno recognized Odoacer's "Kingdom of Italy," the Byzantines sponsored an invasion by the Ostrogoths in 489. Theodoric, leader of the Ostrogoths, led his force into Rome in March 493 and slew Odoacer while they dined together. The fall of Rome in the west was complete. Despite a brief period of reconquest by Byzantium in the 6th Century, the Western Roman Empire would not return.</Text>

			<Text>The Vandals were an East Germanic tribe, their original homeland in Scandinavia. The Vandals crossed the Baltic into Poland at some point in the 2nd Century BC. By 406 AD, the Vandals had reached the Rhine. Attempting to cross it, they met fierce resistance from the Franks, who had settled the Romanized regions of northern Gaul. The Vandals decisively defeated the Frankish army, and then proceeded to plunder their way southward. After sacking Frankish and Roman cities, they reached and crossed the Pyrenees in 409 AD and marched into Iberia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Under pressure from the Visigoths there, Genseric led the Vandals across the straits into North Africa in 429. There Genseric established a Vandal kingdom in 435 when a treaty with Rome gave them control of the province of Numidia. Genseric broke the treaty in 439 and seized Carthage, along with its extensive shipyards and fleet. Over the next decade, along with unrelenting piracy and raids against the Romans and Byzantines, the Vandals overran Sardinia, Sicily, Corsica and the Balearic Islands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the death of Attila, the Roman emperor felt free to end the Vandal incursions and sought to return the lost lands to Rome through his daughter's marriage to Genseric's son. However, through a convoluted series of events and distrust, the effort ended in 455 AD with the landing of a Vandal army in Italy and its capture of Rome.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The sack of Rome proved the highpoint of Vandal power. The death of Genseric in 477, religious tensions, revolts in former Roman provinces, and lack of trade brought a slow decline. In a final costly war, the Byzantine Belisarius crushed the Vandal armies, killed the Vandal general Tzazo and captured most of the Vandal cities. In 534 AD Gelimer, the last Vandal king, surrendered Carthage to the Roman conquerors, ending the Vandal reign forever.</Text>

			<Text>In the face of the Huns' advance, the Visigoths entered Byzantine service as auxiliaries for the right to settle in Roman lands. As a young man, Alaric joined the legions. In 394 he led a Gothic force to aid the empire in defeating the rebel Arbogast. The next year Alaric was elected chief of the Visigoths.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That same year, Theodosius, emperor of Byzantium and Alaric's patron, died. Despite his service to the empire and role as the king of the Visigoths, Alaric was ignored and dismissed in the shuffling of imperial offices that followed. Soon after Theodosius' death Alaric struck at Eastern Rome. Ravaging Greece, he reached the walls of Constantinople in 397 AD, whereupon the emperor appointed Alaric magister militum, who had autonomous military authority.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 407 AD, after estrangement between the two halves of the empire threatened civil war, Alaric led a Visigoth army across the Julian Alps to the outskirts of Rome. Starvation eventually led the Roman Senate to negotiate. Alaric kept his forces in the region, and when the Senate reneged on its treaty, he besieged Rome again. Following this siege, and another settlement with the Senate in 409, in which Alaric set up a puppet emperor in Rome, the Visigoths marched north.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But it was not long before Alaric was forced to return to dethrone his puppet and declare himself king in Italy. In August 410, the Visigoths burst through the Porto Salaria into the city. Alaric showed amazing clemency to the people of Rome; Christian churches were not pillaged, and protection was afforded the thousands of pagans and Christians who took refuge there. Alaric now marched south into Calabria in preparation for invading Africa and securing lost Roman provinces there. But he died suddenly, probably of fever, in the port of Cosenza.</Text>

			<Text>Bahram was the 14th Sassanid king (421-438 AD), gaining the throne after the sudden death (or assassination) of his father Yazdegerd I. Bahram opened his reign with systematic persecution of Christians within his wide-flung lands, a policy that promptly led to war with Eastern Rome. After inconclusive battles and maneuvers, the Persians and Romans signed a treaty in 422 that marked a return to the status quo. However, Bahram shortly thereafter (428 AD) annexed Armenia over the protests of its Christian patriarch Isaac, once again straining Byzantine-Sassanid relations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite the occasional raid or skirmish, peace with Eastern Rome lasted for some years, and gave Bahram the opportunity to indulge himself - and coincidently launch a new Persian golden age. He came to embody royal prosperity, amusing himself with hunting, court parties and sexual pursuits. Under his patronage, some of the great pieces of Sassanid literature, for instance the Karnamag-i Pabagan, and music were created. Sports such as polo became a royal pastime. His adventures in war, hunting and love became myth and legend, and figure even in modern tales such as the famous Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (quatrain 17).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The last stage of Bahram's reign is marked by his conflict with the Huns. The Hephthalite horde of the Huns invaded from the northeast and ravaged much of northern Iran. They crossed into Khorasan and advanced as far as the city of Rei. Unprepared for war, Bahram made an offer of peace and submission which was accepted by the Huns. But gathering a large force, Bahram crossed the province of Tabaristan by night, took the encamped Huns unaware and massacred them, even taking the chieftain's wife captive. The surviving Huns were pursued and slaughtered as far as the Oxus River. Although Bahram was now fatally ill, one of his generals pushed into the horde's homeland to the north and plundered it, ending the Hunnic threat to the Sassanids.</Text>

			<Text>Chlodio was king - or more accurately chieftain - of the Salian Franks from 414 until his death, and considered by some historians to be the founder of the Merovingian dynasty that created France. Controlling the region of what is now Throuanne from his fortress in Duisburg, Chlodio looked to lead his people away from the growing threat posed by migrating Germanic tribes from the east that had been displaced by the advancing Huns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 428 Chlodio challenged Roman limits on the territories held by the Salian Franks, defeated a Roman force at Cambrai, and settled his family and retainers in northern Gaul. In 431, he extended his borders south to the Somme River. By 432 AD the Salian Franks formed a semi-autonomous kingdom within the Roman Empire with the city of Tornacum (Tournai) as capital.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Salian expansion did not end until 448, when Chlodio was defeated by a Romano-Gallic force under Flavius Aetius. The resulting treaty recognized his family's rule in the region, and pledged that the Franks would support Rome's interests in perpetuity. A few years later, the Salian Franks under his son Childeric would join Aetius in halting the advance of the Huns into Europe. His grandson Clovis would unite the Frankish tribes and found the Frankish kingdom that spanned Gaul after his defeats of the Alemanni in 496 and the Visigoths in 507 AD.</Text>

			<Text>Genseric, born around 389 AD, assumed kingship of the Vandals upon the death of his half-brother Gunderic in 428. Beset by the Visigoths, Genseric quickly determined to lead his people out of Iberia to the less populous shores of Africa. Building a fleet at the straits, in 429 AD some 80,000 warriors, women and children crossed into Roman Africa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Taking advantage of their squabbles, the Vandals quickly overwhelmed the divided Roman garrisons. Within months, they had conquered what is now Morocco and Algeria, and the Emperor Valentinian III signed a peace treaty recognizing Genseric's sovereignty. Genseric however, looked for more, and in 439 broke the treaty and invaded the lands around Roman Carthage. Taken unaware, the city, along with the massive fleet moored there, fell. With this fleet, the equivalent of Rome's and Byzantium's combined, the Vandals raided Roman commerce and coasts, and seized the islands in the western Mediterranean, including Sicily.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now undisputed master of a vast kingdom, Genseric turned his attention to crafting a code of laws and to securing trade routes to and through Eastern Rome. This led to an arrangement with Valentinian to marry the emperor's daughter to Genseric's son. But in 455 Valentinian III was assassinated. Genseric believed this voided his treaty, landed in Italy, brushed aside the small forces that challenged him, and entered Rome. Pope Leo I implored him not to destroy the city, and Genseric withdrew ... but not before his men plundered Rome.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 468 he was the target of the last combined campaign of the two halves of the old Roman Empire. Against all odds, Genseric defeated the larger Byzantine fleet off Cap Bon. Following the defeat, Genseric invaded Greece but the Vandals were driven back with heavy losses. Genseric negotiated peace with Byzantium in 474, and died peacefully in his palace in 477 AD.</Text>

			<Text>Honorius (384-423 AD) was the younger son of Roman Emperor Theodosius I. When Theodosius died in 395, he divided the empire between his son Arcadius in the east and the eight-year-old Honorius in the west. His reign was chaotic, although the support of the able general Stilicho - initially Honorius's guardian, later his father-in-law - brought some measure of stability. The reign of Honorius is now seen as the beginning of the end of Western Rome, which would collapse completely within a century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Honorius was plagued by almost constant barbarian incursions and revolts - in Gaul, Iberia, North Africa and Italy itself. The first crisis was a two-year revolt in Africa, eventually subdued by Stilicho. It was quickly followed by the Visigoth invasion of Italy under their king Alaric I. Stilicho returned and summoned the legions of Britain to defeat them in 406 AD. That same year an enormous horde composed of Ostrogoths, Alans and Vandals crossed the frozen Rhine into Gaul. In response, by 410 Britain was abandoned entirely and the legions formerly there were used to hold the Rhine against further invasions. Meanwhile Honorius fled Rome as the Visigoths approached, sacking the city in 410 before withdrawing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the last years of his reign, Honorius was forced to grant Roman lands to various barbarian tribes. A treaty signed in 418 allowed the Visigoths to establish a kingdom in southwestern Gaul, from which they would spread into Roman holdings in Iberia. A Frankish client-state was created in northern Gaul, ostensibly under the rule of Honorius but in actuality governed by the Salian Frank Chlodio. By Honorius's death, large portions of the Western Roman Empire were under barbarian control, laying the foundations for the medieval kingdoms of Britain, France and Spain. But he had managed to keep the core of the empire intact. Honorius died of edema in August 423, leaving no heir. The following year, the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II appointed his cousin, Valentinian III, the new emperor in the west.</Text>

			<Text>Located in southwest Bavaria, Augsburg was founded in 15 BC by Tiberius, soon becoming the military and economic capital of the Roman province of Raetia. Although sacked by Attila in the 5th Century AD, by Charlemagne in the 8th, and by Welf of Bavaria in the 11th, each time the city rose to greater prosperity due to its location astride many of the trade routes over the Alps. Augsburg, because of its strategic location, was decreed an Imperial Free City under the auspices of the Holy Roman Empire in March 1276. That put it at the center of the Catholic-Protestant wars of the 1600s. Augsburg's golden age spanned the 15th and 16th centuries under the great mercantile houses of the Fuggers and the Welsers; its wealth attracted artists seeking patrons, and it became a center for music, literature, painting and architecture. In 1806 when the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by Napoleon, Augsburg lost its free-city status and became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The next century saw the city quickly converted to textile, steel and military manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution as part of a unified and expansive Germany. Although devastated during World War II, Augsburg has rebounded to again become one of the great cities of Europe.</Text>

			<Text>In 50 AD Rome founded the fortress-city of Colonia on the Rhine to protect the province of Germania Inferior. Prospering under the Romans, and later the Franks, the city became one of the most important trading and religious centers north of the Alps. In 785 it was made the seat of an archbishopric. As part of the Holy Roman Empire, the free city was home to one of the seven prince-electors and three ecclesiastical electors who chose the emperor. Along with one of the grandest cathedrals of the time, the city was also a major harbor and trading center on the Rhine, the site of the charterhouses of a number of influential, self-governing guilds. During the Reformation, the city remained steadfastly Catholic, despite the efforts of two archbishops who converted to Lutheranism. The faculty at the famous university, one of the oldest in Europe, publically burned Luther's works in 1520 AD. Cologne lost its status as a free city in 1798 when occupied by the new French Republic. In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna, it became part of Prussia, and then of Germany after the unification of that nation in 1871. Targeted by the Allies during the Second World War, Cologne endured 262 air raids, which destroyed 95% of the city. It was not until 1959 that Cologne would regain its pre-war population numbers and be fully rebuilt into a modern industrial metropolis.</Text>

			<Text>As the birthplace of Mohammed and the Koran, Mecca is the holiest city of Islam and a pilgrimage (the Hajj) to it is an obligation for all Muslims. Although its founding is unknown except in myth, by the 6th Century AD it was a vital link in the spice trade, and its camel caravans made it one of the wealthiest cities in the world at the time. Mohammed was born in the city in 570, and the history of Islam has been inextricably interwoven with it since. Mohammed's march to Medina shifted the political center of the rapidly expanding Muslim kingdom to that city, but Mecca remained the center of the faith. With a growing number of scholars and faithful who wished to live close to the Kaaba, and a burgeoning class of merchants and shopkeepers to serve the needs of the pilgrims, Mecca prospered throughout the next centuries despite the rise and fall of caliphs and conquerors. In 1517 AD it became part of the Ottoman Empire; following the collapse of the Ottomans at the end of World War I, the city fell under the rule of the Saudis. Today, Mecca is home to the Masjid al-Haram, the world's largest mosque, a world-class madrasah, and numerous religious and historic sites. A pilgrimage to it remains one of Islam's Five Pillars of faith.</Text>

A microcosm of Europe, the city has witnessed the coming and going of many occupiers, each leaving traces of its culture and bloodlines. From 1282 through 1816 AD, it was the center of the rich and vibrant Kingdom of Naples, a prominent player in the struggles of the great nations of the time. It was occupied in turn by the French, the Spanish, the Austrians, again by the Spanish, and yet again by the French before gaining its independence at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1815 it was combined with Sicily in the Congress of Vienna to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which survived until the unification of Italy in 1861.

Although rebuilt and occupied by the Romans, Tunis would not gain prominence until the 7th Century AD under the control of Arab Muslims. Recognizing the strategic importance of its proximity to Europe, from the 900s on it became the primary naval base in the western Mediterranean of successive Islamic dynasties. Following yet another revolt, the Almohad al-Mumin took the city in 1159 and established it as a trading center; from the 12th through the 16th centuries, Tunis was one of the richest and most strategic ports in the world. The Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 AD; after a brief Spanish occupation ended in 1574, the Ottoman governors there became relatively autonomous. Under the Husainid rulers, to its traditional trade and industry was added the plunder of the Barbary corsairs, then at their peak of activity. After a succession of rebellions, invasions and occupations, the French ruled the area from 1881 through 1956. Gaining its independence, Tunis has been the capital city of Tunisia since the French withdrawal, a cosmopolitan center of trade and culture for the region.</Text>

			<Text>The Almohad dynasty was founded in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco by the Berber Ibn Tumart in the early 12th Century. Originally a religious movement, the Almohads under Tumart rebelled against the ruling Almoravids, united the Berber and Moorish tribes, and in a few decades dominated all the Magreb and Morocco. Energized by religious zeal, the Almohads quickly extended their rule across the straits to Iberia (modern Portugal and southern Spain). In 1170, they transferred their capital to Seville.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite continuous attempts by Christian monarchs to reclaim the peninsula, Almohad domination of Iberia continued until 1212. In that year, a coalition of forces from Castile, Aragon, Portugal and Navarre decisively defeated Muhammad III at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Over the next four decades the Moorish territories were taken by Christian rulers, with the great city of Cordoba falling in 1236, and Seville in 1248. By 1260, all that remained after the Reconquista was the Moorish fortress city of Grenada, which remained independent for another 250 years.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Africa, the Almohads fended off incursions by Norman adventurers and revolts by native tribes, even entering into alliances with Castile to do so. But over time, they lost districts and towns to rebellion and incursions by other peoples, most notably the Marinids, a Zenata Berber dynasty that would eventually replace them in the Magreb. In 1265, the last Almohad ruler, Idris al-Wathiq was reduced to controlling only the capital of Marrakesh. In 1268 the city was besieged; Marrakesh fell in September 1269 and Idris was assassinated by a slave.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Almohads left a legacy of art and learning unmatched by the successive Islamic dynasties. Caliphs such as al-Mansur sponsored and protected philosophers such as Averroes and the Jew Maimonides. The architecture of the Almohads was renowned, exemplified by the Giralda in Seville, the Koutouba mosque in Marrakesh, the Hassan Tower in Rabat, and the minaret in Safi. Under the Almohad reign Jewish culture experienced a "Golden Age," and Jews from other parts of Christian Europe made their way to Moorish Iberia, where they contributed to Almohad advances in medicine and science. Despite lasting but 160 years, the cultural contributions of the Almohads echo still across modern North Africa and Iberia.</Text>

			<Text>The "Ottoman Turks" first became known to Western Europe in 1227 AD when the tribe migrated into the Seljuk kingdom in Anatolia. Their chieftain Ertugrul would found a principality amid the decaying Seljuk lands in western Anatolia. His son Osman (for whom the kingdom was named by Europeans) and grandson Orhan would greatly expand the empire. Militarily sophisticated, by 1362, these Turks would cross the Dardanelles strait into the last vestiges of the Byzantine Balkans. The Turks became a great power when, in 1453, Sultan Mehmed II captured Byzantium, renaming it Istanbul and making it his capital. The Ottoman Empire would become the largest and longest lasting one of the Middle Ages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Having taken Constantinople, seat of Orthodox Christianity, Mehmed displayed his political acumen by meeting with the Orthodox patriarch Gennadios. Although the empire would be Muslim, in exchange for tolerance and maintaining its holdings and authority, the Orthodox Church agreed to accept Ottoman authority in all things secular. The Christians within the empire became supporters of the regime and even joined the Ottomans in their efforts against the Catholic West.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following the fall of Constantinople, the Turks began an unrelenting effort to expand westward and southward. They overran the Balkans, spread across the Levant and Egypt, dominated the Eastern Mediterranean. Their sea-borne trade routes reached across the Black, Aegean and Mediterranean seas and, via the Red Sea, reached the Indian Ocean and the Orient. Expansion into Europe was not halted until the Turkish defeats at the gates of Vienna in 1529 and 1532. Thwarted, they turned to the conquest of the North African coast. By 1566, the Turkish Empire stretched from Bagdad to Budapest to Algiers to Mecca.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this period of expansion, the Ottomans were blessed with a long series of able and enlightened sultans, from Mehmed through Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent. Religious tolerance of Orthodox Christianity and Judaism brought economic and intellectual benefits. The cultural traditions and social institutions of the polyglot empire blended to insure a golden age of art and science. Free education in madrasas, expanding literacy, and patronage by the ruling elite made the empire more stable and peaceful than the Western kingdoms.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But by the 1600s, the empire would begin its long decline. The rise of Muscovite Russia and the Mongol onslaught from the east would end Ottoman efforts to spread into Catholic Europe. In the Mediterranean, a coalition of Catholic powers led by Philip II of Spain would end Turkish dominance at Lepanto in 1571. The influx of wealth from the New World made Europe less reliant on the trade routes to and through the Ottoman Empire. Despite the upheaval of the Protestant Reformation, the Turks would never again threaten Christian Europe.</Text>

			<Text>A Muslim dynasty of Kurdish origins, the Ayyubid sultanate was founded by Salah ad-Din (Saladin) and centered in Egypt, ruling most of the Middle East in the 12th and 13th centuries. By 1183 AD, the sultanate included Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Mesopotamia, Kurdistan, Hejaz, Yemen and much of the Levant. The Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem fell to Ayyubid forces in 1187, sparking the Christian Third Crusade led by Richard the Lionheart and Philip Augustus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the death of Saladin, his sons fought for control of the sultanate, with Saladin's brother al-Adil eventually establishing himself as sultan in 1200 AD. However, the kingdom was troubled by Syrian revolts in 1230 through 1247, when order was restored. But in the meantime, successful revolts against Ayyubid rule in Yemen, Hejaz and areas of Mesopotamia had fragmented the sultanate. Repelling a Crusader invasion of the Nile delta so weakened Ayyubid rule that Mamluk generals overthrew Sultan al-Muazzam Turanshah in 1250, ending the family's control of the heart of the sultanate. Ayyubid rule was now briefly centered on Aleppo, which was sacked by the rampaging Mongols in 1260. Within a few years, the Mongols had erased what remained of Ayyubid power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although of relatively short length, Ayyubid rule ushered in an age of prosperity in the lands they held and a resurgence of Islamic culture and science in the region. Based on the principle espoused by Saladin of collective sovereignty, Ayyubid rule was relatively benign and enlightened. First Damascus and later Cairo as the capital witnessed a flowering of art and literature. Ayyubid patronage led to the construction of numerous Sunni madrasas. Of special interest to the Ayyubids, studies in medicine, pharmacology and botany were encouraged and physicians such as Ibn al-Baytar, al-Dakhwar and Rashidun al-Suri developed procedures and treatments not found elsewhere in the world for decades.</Text>

Al-Mansur vowed revenge for his father's death and landed in Iberia, capturing and sacking Christian cities before returning to Morocco with 3000 captives. There he spent several years strengthening his kingdom both culturally and diplomatically.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During his absence from Iberia, the Castilian king Alfonso VIII again sought to "reconquer" Moorish territories in Iberia. Gathering the largest army of the period, reportedly 300,000, the Christians captured a number of Almohad cities, including Silves and Beja. Returning with a vengeance, al-Mansur decisively defeated Alfonso at the Battle of Alarcos in July 1195, inflicting 150,000 casualties on the Christians; after the victory al-Mansur was given the title "Made Victorious by God" by his people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition to his military successes, al-Mansur reigned with distinction. Under his rule, trade, art and the sciences flourished. He oversaw the construction of the great mosques of Koutouba and el-Mansouria in Marrakesh and the Udayas kasbah in Rabat. Al-Mansur was patron to the philosopher Ibn Rushd (known as Averroes among Christians) and other artists and scholars. He funded construction of what would have been the world's largest mosque in Rabat, but work was halted upon al-Mansur's premature death.</Text>

			<Text>King of France from 1515 AD until his death, Francis I (1494-1547) oversaw significant cultural and political changes in his country. His life-long rivalry with Holy Roman Emperor Charles V for hegemony over Christian Europe was the root of a ruinous military and economic conflict that contributed to the outbreak of the Protestant revolution. In 1514, upon the death of Louis, who had married three times but had no son, Francis was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims on New Year's Day of 1515.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Francis did not receive the humanist education his mother had wanted, but nonetheless was renowned as a "man of letters." Renaissance ideas and ideals had arrived in France by the time he ascended the throne, and Francis patronized some of the greatest artists and scholars of his time, including da Vinci, Cellini, del Sarto and others, many of whom he encouraged to come to France and spending vast sums on their upkeep. He employed numerous royal agents to scour Italy for books and manuscripts, and in 1537 he decreed that his library be given a copy of every new book sold in France.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However it is as a military leader and diplomat that Francis I is remembered. Most of his actions were focused on Charles V, for whom he had a personal dislike, with Italy as the battleground. In 1515, shortly after taking the crown, he defeated the Swiss at Marignano, leading to his capture of the city-state of Milan. But following a decade of skirmishing, Francis was captured by Spanish forces at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. Held captive in Madrid, he was forced to sign the Treaty of Madrid the following year.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Returning to France, Francis promptly claimed he had signed the agreement with Charles under duress and repudiated it. This led to a second series of wars between the Habsburg and the French. With an alliance with the Ottoman Turks, the Italian wars of 1536-1538 and 1542-1546 were largely inconclusive until Francis finally forced Charles, facing scattered revolts in his lands, to sign the Treaty of Crepy. In the process of his wars, looking to counter-balance the power of Habsburg Spain, Francis I sought to establish holdings and contacts in the New World and Asia. The French port of Le Havre was founded in 1517 to facilitate this effort.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Francis I died in March 1547 at the Chateau Rambouillet. His legacy is still debated. He brought great cultural advances, but at the cost of a bankrupt economy. His persecution of Protestants, as embodied by the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1540, led to several massacres, and set off decades of civil unrest. Despite his interest in books and humanism, he issued orders for censorship, which forced thinkers such as John Calvin into exile. His cycle of wars resulted in no strategic or economic advantages for France. For better or worse, the shadow of Francis I lay across the continent for years after his death.</Text>

			<Text>Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub, better known as Saladin, was a Kurdish noble who rose to become the first sultan of Egypt and Syria. Born in Tikrit (Iraq) around 1138 AD, his military training began at the age of 26 under the tutelage of his uncle Asad, an influential commander in service to Nur ad-Din, governor of the Syrian province of the Seljuk Empire. In a campaign against Crusaders and the Egyptian usurper Dirgham, Saladin distinguished himself in the sack of Bilbais and at a battle near the Nile west of Giza. Proceeding to Alexandria, Saladin entered the city unopposed and in 1169 was appointed vizier by al-Adid, the Fatimid caliph. Two years later Saladin was ordered to establish a caliphate in Egypt by Nur ad-Din. Upon Nur's death in 1174, Saladin proclaimed the establishment of the Ayyubid dynasty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Using Egypt as his base, Saladin spent the next few years expanding his authority, and autonomy. Yemen had already been occupied in 1173; the fall of Damascus and the fortress at Hamas to his forces in 1174 added Syria. Following his defeat of the rival Zengids there, Saladin returned to Cairo to devote himself to strengthening his rule. He oversaw the fortification of Cairo, the digging of the Bir Yusef well, construction of a bridge at Giza and several new madrasas. But after Crusader raids into his territory, Saladin turned his attention to Palestine in 1177.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Saladin's war against the Christians raged until his death in 1193 AD. Marked by a string of Ayyubid victories and the occupation of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187, including the holy city itself, Saladin became infamous in Europe. The result was the Third Crusade - mounted by England's Richard the Lionheart, Philip II of France, Frederick Barbarossa, among others - marked more by massacres than battles. By September 1191, the Crusader army had been reduced to about 2000 men-at-arms and 50 knights fit for battle. Richard and Saladin finally came to an agreement, the Treaty of Ramla in 1192, whereby Jerusalem would remain in Muslim control but be open to Christian pilgrimages.</Text>

			<Text>Roman Catholicism refers to the theology and doctrine of the Christian church under the auspices of the Holy See, the papacy based in Rome. According to ecclesiastical scholars, Catholicism is distinguished from other branches of Christianity by its commitment to the church's traditions, to the sacraments, and its priesthood as interpreters of the Bible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The earliest known use of the term "Catholic Church" is by Ignatius of Antioch around 107 AD. The early church was organized based on the rule of three patriarchs, those of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch - to which were later added the patriarchs of Constantinople and Jerusalem. The patriarch of Rome claimed special authority based on the connection between St. Peter and the city. For 1000 years, Roman Catholicism dominated Europe, until the Great Schism of 1054 AD that gave rise to Eastern Orthodoxy. Some 500 years later another major division in Christianity occurred with the Protestant Reformation, which saw many in Europe reject the teachings and practices of Catholicism in favor of more personal expressions of belief.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Presently, the Roman Catholic Church considers those not in communion with the Vatican to be "non-Catholics" but tolerates differing interpretations of the Bible. Roman Catholicism remains the largest Christian church, with over a billion members worldwide.</Text>

Replacing the shrine, construction of "old" St. Peter's was begun by the Emperor Constantine between 319 and 333 AD. Having fallen into serious disrepair over the centuries, Pope Julius II in 1505 determined to demolish the old church and replace it with a monumental structure, a construction project that spanned the next 120 years under a succession of popes and architects. To finance the colossal project, a number of popes authorized the wholesale selling of indulgences, a practice that led in part to Martin Luther's protestant movement.

It is here when the country gained a formal strategic vision and started to focus more on building a strong economy and completing civil works projects. Seeing such a valuable jewel on its borders, the Mongols attempted to invade the Dai Viet in 1257, 1284, and 1288, all unsuccessfully.  The Dai Viet did what most other nations at the time could not - they avoided the superior Mongol forces in the open field and fought the horsemen only where they had the upper hand, securing the independence of their nation.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_MONGOL_SCENARIO_CIV5_DALI_TEXT">
			<Text>Located in the modern Yunnan Province of China, the kingdom of Dali was founded in 937 AD after a period of turbulent, smaller dynasties.  The kingdom's territory lent itself naturally to defense, and it was said that just a few men could protect the valley for years.  This claim seems to hold some truth, as the Mongols attempted repeatedly to invade the kingdom, all unsuccessfully.  Records show that the Mongolian army eventually located a traitor from Dali to lead them over the mountains through a secret passage, finally giving them the means to overrun the impregnable defenses.  In 1253 the Mongols completed their invasion of the state, eventually creating the Province of Yunnan in 1274.</Text>

			<Text>Inhabited since the early Stone Age, the complete unification of the area did not occur until the 11th century AD, under King Bagrat V.  The new kingdom of Georgia quickly flourished and reached its zenith only one short century later.  This Georgian Renaissance brought a multitude of advancements to the area, including breakthroughs in philosophy, the penmanship of epic poetry, and the construction of exquisite cathedrals.  Despite its quick and successful development, the Georgian Golden Age came crashing to an end with the Mongol invasion in 1236; the kingdom completely collapsed by the end of the 15th century.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_MONGOL_SCENARIO_CIV5_GREECE_TEXT_1">
			<Text>The ancient Greek city of Byzantium, destined to become the seat of power for two distinct empires, was founded in 667 BC by a Greek colonist named Byzas. Although the early history of Byzantium is intertwined with the legends of Greek mythology, historians are relatively confident that these settlers traveled from the Greek city of Megara after sailing across the Aegean Sea.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Strategically positioned near the trade routes connecting Europe to Asia, Byzantium quickly grew in size and prosperity. In 324 AD, the Roman Emperor Constantine would choose to rebuild Byzantium in the image of Rome itself, forming the new capital of the Eastern Roman Empire (known as the Byzantine Empire in the present day). The city would henceforth be known to the people as Constantinople, and would remain the capital of the Byzantine Empire until its fall some 1000 years later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1453 the Ottoman Empire would capture the city of Constantinople, sounding the death knell of the Byzantine Empire. The Ottoman ruler, Mehmed II, would however continue the legacy of Constantinople by declaring it the new capital of the Ottoman Empire.  Although known to the Turks as "Istanbul," the city would not be officially renamed until 1930.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]From Byzantium to Constantinople to Istanbul, the small Greek colony has grown from its early roots to become one of the world's largest and most prosperous cities. Modern Istanbul is considered a "megacity," with a population of over 13 million people, making it the largest city in Turkey.  A UNESCO World Heritage site, Istanbul continues the traditions of its past with a vast and varied array of social and cultural events occurring each year.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_MONGOL_SCENARIO_CIV5_HUNGARY_TEXT">
			<Text>Founded in 895 AD, Hungary is one of the oldest countries in Europe.  For centuries the kingdom repelled many attacks against its borders and housed some of the wealthiest kings on the continent - at one point the Hungarian king's income doubled that of England's monarch.  In 1217, the crown led the Fifth Crusade into the Holy Land, in the process creating the largest royal army in the history of the Crusades.  However, not even this mighty army could stop the sweeping arm of the Mongolian Empire.  In 1241, the Mongols invaded Hungary and killed roughly half of the country's population, almost 1 million people.  The Hungarian king Bla IV ordered the construction of hundreds of stone fortifications along the borders, stopping some smaller forces, but the greatest damage had already been done.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_MONGOL_SCENARIO_CIV5_KOREA_TEXT">
			<Text>At the time of the Mongolian Empire, the Kingdom of Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty, which took power in 918 AD.  During this reign the nation flourished: its laws were codified, a civil service system was introduced,  and it made great cultural advancements with the creation of the world's first movable-metal-type printing press.  Starting in the 1230s however, the kingdom became threatened by Mongolian forces, who continued a heated invasion attempt for the next few decades.  In 1259 the nation sued for peace, and a treaty was drawn up between Korea and the Mongols.   The Goryeo were allowed to keep their sovereignty, while the Mongolian Empire annexed a large portion of the northern Provinces.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_MONGOL_SCENARIO_CIV5_SIAM_TEXT_1">
			<Text>The Jin Dynasty (also known as the Jurchen Dynasty) was established in 1115 AD in the area of northeast China historically known as Manchuria.  The Jurchens, a tribal people descended from the earlier Mohe tribes inhabiting this region, were primarily hunter-gatherers living as vassals under the Liao Dynasty. Unified under the guidance of Wanyan Aguda, leader of the Wanyan tribe, the Jurchens would quickly conquer the Liao and much of northern China. Wanyan would take the name "Jin" for his new Dynasty, meaning "Golden".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Much like the Mongols, the Jurchen were known for their fearsome cavalry, whose talents are said to have developed as a result of the strong hunting traditions within the tribes. Having crushed the Liao with the assistance of the Song Dynasty, the Jurchens would invade Song territory, leading to nearly 20 years of continuous war. In 1141, the Treaty of Shaoxing would lead to peace between the two dynasties, creating a border at the Huai River.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At its peak, the Jin Dynasty encompassed more than 30 million people and the entirety of Northern China. However, the rise of Genghis Khan brought new leadership to the neighboring Mongol tribes, and soon the Mongols would begin their legendary conquest of Asia, including the Jin.  By 1227, the year of Genghis Khan's death, the Mongols had decimated much of the Jin's forces. However, the valiant warriors of the Jin would manage to resist Mongol domination for another 7 years after Genghis' death, finally succumbing to the Mongol forces in 1234.</Text>

			<Text>Founded in 742 AD, the Golden Age of the Uighur Empire quickly began and extended into the latter 8th century.  However, the young and fledgling empire was conquered by the Kyrgyz in 840, and the Uighur scattered into three kingdoms: Gansu, Turpan and Karakhanids. This scenario concerns the Uighur in Turpan, a fairly successful tribal kingdom which lasted until the Mongol invasion of 1389.  The Mongols eventually adopted Uighur script as their writing system after the Uighurs became their vassals.</Text>

			<Text>The Western Xia Dynasty, or Tangut Empire, was founded in 1038 AD when a Tangut chieftain named himself emperor of the Da Xia region.  Not much later, the kingdom suffered massive destruction from rounds of Mongol invasions led by Genghis Khan - six different attacks over the course of twenty-two years. Genghis died during the last round of attacks (the cause of death still being debated), and the enraged horde overran the capital in 1227, destroying buildings and written records, murdering the emperor, and killing tens of thousands in the process.</Text>

The largest Mayan Pyramid is located at El Mirador, measuring nearly 260 feet in height.  By volume (almost 99 million cubic feet) it is one of the largest pyramids in the world.</Text>

With a complex culture and commerce based on aquaculture, their economic influence reached as far north as present-day Georgia. The Spanish recorded that they traded nets, fish hooks, sisal, floats, fish traps, paddles, bowls, ear ornaments, masks, plaques, cypress wood, and "ornamental standards" with other tribes. The Calusa and Europeans co-existed in an uneasy truce until the Spanish-English war in 1702, in which the English-armed and allied Creek and Yamasee virtually obliterated the Calusa, the few survivors fleeing deep into the swamps.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_NEWWORLD_SCENARIO_CIV5_IMPROVEMENTS_POLDER_TEXT">
			<Text>A polder is a low-lying tract enclosed by dikes with the water drained. In general, polder is land reclaimed from a lake or seabed, from flood plains, or from marshes. In time, the drained land subsides so that all polder is eventually below the surrounding water level. Because of this, water seeps into the drained area and must be pumped out or otherwise drained. The dikes are usually made of readily available materials, earth or sand; in modern times these barriers might be covered or completely composed of concrete. The drained land is extremely fertile and makes excellent pasturage or cropland.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first polders of reclaimed land were constructed in the 11th Century AD, although building embankments as barriers to water date back to the Romans. The Dutch have a long history of reclaiming marshes and fenland, and even the seabed, and possess half of the polder acreage in Europe. Although there are polders in other countries of Europe, and examples can be found in Asia and North America, Holland has some 3000 polders accounting for about 27 percent of the country's land. Amsterdam itself is built largely upon polder. As the Dutch homily states, "God made the world, but the Dutch made Holland."</Text>

			<Text>Terrace Farming developed in mountainous areas simultaneously around the world, including Bali, the Philippines, China and Peru.  These skinny, stepped fields are cut into hill and mountain sides, preventing the run off of irrigation water and providing space for arable land, usually where none previously was possible. The Incas in particular were masters of terrace farming, and erected large, drystone walls to hold their terraces in place.  After building the terrace's shape, the Incas then constructed systems of canals and aqueducts to provide the terraces with constant water, increasing the land's fertility.  The ancient Incan's terracing techniques were so successful that modern Peruvian farmers still employ them in their farms today.</Text>

While the empire only lasted for one brief century, it did much to unify the people and culture of the different tribes living on the mountain tops.

The climate and geography were mountainous, but early on the Incas perfected the art of terrace farming and easily lived among the ridges.

			<Text>Before it was a mighty empire, the Incas hailed from the small Kingdom of Cusco, situated in western Peru.  Under the leadership of Pachacuti, the ninth Sapa Inca, Cusco embarked upon a campaign to subjugate the surrounding tribes under one banner. Using both military conquests and peaceful assimilations, Pachacuti and his son Tupac laid the foundation for the Tahuantinsuyu Empire.  The appellation was a literal naming of the empire, signifying its creation from four separate provinces - Chinchasuyu in the northwest, Antisuyu in the northeast, Contisuyu to the southwest, and Collasuyu to the southeast.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pachacuti set up a new system of government in order to keep his acquisitions in order. Children of the ruling families were made to relocate to Cusco (the capital) and learn from the Incas directly, becoming indoctrinated into their culture and way of life.  Once they were older, the children were returned to their original provinces in the empire, helping to spread the Incan culture.</Text>

At this point in time, the Incas only had one main rival left along the western shores, the Chimor tribe.  Tupac quickly dispatched them and added their holdings to the growing empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tupac's son Huayna Capac later added a few additional pieces of present-day Ecuador to the empire, but his southern expansion was halted at the Battle of the Maule.  There the Mapuche tribes stopped the Incas in their tracks. This wasn't a complete loss for the Incas since most of the land in this area of the empire was predominately desert wasteland, and the majority of the population remained in the Andes.</Text>

			<Text>In 1526, the Inca's domination of the land began its downward spiral.  Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro reached the Incan territory as he explored south from Panama, and immediately petitioned the crown for permission to invade - he believed fervently that the land was ripe with treasure.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He returned with a small force in 1532 to find the empire ready for the taking.  Huayna's two sons, Huascar and Atahualpa, were engaged in a civil war over control of the territories, and the introduction of smallpox had wreaked considerable havoc among its populace.  Pizarro's force (168 men, 1 cannon, and 27 horses) were no match for the Inca in numbers, but their superior technology and military tactics saw them through in the end.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pizarro's first battle, the Battle of Pun, occurred later that year near present-day Guayaquil, Ecuador, which he handily won.  One of his men, Hernando de Soto, was sent further inland to explore as Pizarro founded a new city in the area, Piura. De Soto encountered the triumphant Atahualpa and returned to Pizarro with an invitation to meet. The Spaniards demanded that the Incas accept Charles I of Spain as their emperor and convert immediately to Christianity.  Perhaps due to a language barrier or poor communication skills in general, Atahualpa didn't fully grasp the exact message of the meeting and sent further communications demanding more explanation.  Frustrated and annoyed, instead of finding a better translator the Spanish attacked Atahualpa's camp and took the leader as hostage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Incan King offered Pizarro a massive amount of gold and silver for his release, which he promptly accepted. Pizarro however didn't keep his end of the bargain and refused to release Atahualpa to the Incas.  During this time, Huascar was assassinated and Pizarro used this to his advantage - claiming that Atahualpa was behind the dirty deed.  At a shady trial run by the Spanish, Atahualpa was sentenced to death in August 1533.</Text>

Manco, once secure in his own power base, attempted to take back his empire with the capture of Cusco in 1536, but he was no match for the Spanish invaders. He and his court fled to the mountains of Peru, where they continued to rule for the next 36 years.  However, in 1572 the last Incan stronghold fell, and Manco's son and current king, Tupac Amaru was executed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All the Incan royalty dead, the new Spanish rulers brutally oppressed the native people and attempted to strip them of their culture, religion, and traditions. Each Incan family was required to send a family member to work in the Spanish gold and silver mines, and replace them immediately upon the worker's death, which happened roughly every one to two years due to poor working conditions. Smallpox continued to spread rapidly through the remains of the empire, claiming somewhere between 60% and 90% of the population.  Typhus, influenza, diphtheria, and measles did the rest - by 1618 almost all traces of the Incan culture were lost. All that is left now of their once glorious civilization is a smattering of scattered tribes and stone outcroppings, relics of a distant past.</Text>

			<Text>Isabella was born on April 22, 1451 in vila to John II of Castile and Isabella of Portugal.  She had an older brother, Henry (her elder by 26 years), and later a younger brother Alfonso, who displaced her in the line of succession.  When her father died in 1454, Henry took the throne of Castile as King Henry IV, and Isabella and her family moved to Arvalo and lived in a destitute castle, where her mother slowly started to lose her sanity. It wasn't until years later, when Henry's wife gave birth, that Henry allowed his siblings to move back to the main court in Segovia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Here Isabella was educated in all manners of queenly disciplines and her life improved considerably, but Henry did put one limiting condition on her - she was forbidden to leave Segovia without his permission.  Henry claimed this was to keep Isabella from the political turmoil brewing in the kingdom over his choice of heir (his new daughter Joanna), but it could have also been to restrict her access to the rebelling noblemen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The nobles, however, had no problem speaking with her younger brother Alfonso, and he instigated the Second Battle of Olmedo in 1467, demanding that he be made Henry's heir.  As a compromise, Henry named Alfonso the Prince of Asturias, a title that would be given to the heir apparent of both Castile and Leon, and thought about marrying his daughter Joanna to Alfonso.  But Alfonso didn't have long to enjoy his new role; he soon died, probably a casualty of the plague.  Alfonso had named Isabella his successor in his will, and the title passed to her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rather than continue the rebellion against her older brother, Isabella met with Henry at Toros de Guisando and negotiated a permanent peace settlement. Henry would officially name Isabella as his heir, but she would not be allowed to marry without his consent.  However, Henry could also not force her to marry against her will.  Both parties pleased with their settlement, Henry began his search for a fitting husband for his younger sister.</Text>

			<Text>At this time, Isabella was betrothed to Ferdinand, son of John II of Aragon (and had been since the age of three), but Henry broke off this agreement.  Instead, he attempted to wed Isabella to Charles IV of Navarre, another of John's sons, but John refused the offer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Soon after in 1464, Henry attempted to marry Isabella off to King Edward IV of England, but Edward also refused.  Many attempts were then made to wed the girl to Alfonso V of Portugal, but she refused him at the altar due to his old age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Castilian's personal soap opera continued with Isabella's betrothal to Pedro Giron, the brother of Henry's favorite Don.  Isabella prayed feverishly that the marriage be called off, as Don Pedro was 27years older than she.  Isabella fervently believed that God had answered her plea, as the Don died from a burst appendix on the way to greet his fiance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Next up in Henry's shrinking line of suitors was Louis XI's brother Charles, Duke of Berry.  At this point Isabella had had enough of Henry's thinly veiled attempts to remove her from the line of succession with a poor political marriage, and she began to negotiate with John II of Aragon in secret to once again secure a marriage to his son Ferdinand.</Text>

			<Text>Although all parties were in favor of the marriage of Isabella and Ferdinand (except of course for Henry, who was still trying to woo France and Portugal), there was one small problem - the young couple were second cousins.  By church law, a Papal Bull was required for a wedding of closely related cousins, but the Pope was loathe to grant one from fear of retribution from Castile, Portugal, and France.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, Isabella refused to marry without the dispensation, as she was by this point a very devout woman.  Ferdinand sought the help of Rodrigo Borgia in Rome (later Pope Alexander VI) and presented Isabella with a "Papal Bull" from Pius II.  The probable forgery was good enough for her and she quickly agreed to the marriage.  With the excuse of visiting her brother's tomb in Avila, Isabella managed to escape Henry's sight and Ferdinand slipped into Castile disguised as a merchant.  Isabella's rather Shakespearian journey ended on October 19, 1469 when she wedded Ferdinand in Valladolid.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Henry found out about the marriage rather quickly after this, and pleaded with the Pope to dissolve the marriage.  The new Pope, Sixtus IV, didn't have any of his predecessor's qualms about Castilian hostilities and instead gifted the wedded couple a real Papal Bull, thwarting Henry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A few years later in 1474, Henry died and a succession war broke out across Castile.  Portugal supported Henry's daughter, Joanna, to take the throne, but Isabella had the support of Aragon (through Ferdinand) and later France.  The war dragged on for four years, but ultimately Sixtus IV again came to Isabella's rescue. The Pope annulled Joanna's marriage to Alfonso V of Portugal, ironically on the grounds of their close familial relationship.  Joanna was forced to renounce her titles of Princess and Queen of Castile, and the throne passed to Isabella on January 20, 1479.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The early years of Isabella's reign mostly involved solidifying her power base and continuing the Reconquista (Recapturing) of the Iberian Peninsula.  However, her reign became memorable, in the momentous year of 1492.</Text>

			<Text>Almost everything Isabella is known for in history took place in this year: the end of the Reconquista, the patronage of Christopher Columbus, and the intensification of the Inquisition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Spanning seven centuries, a lengthy war known as the Reconquista was fought by the Iberian monarchs, who were attempting to regain control of the region and force the Muslims out.  For the last 200 of these years, the Emirate of Granada remained the final stronghold of the Muslim dynasties on the Iberian Peninsula. Isabella and Ferdinand continued the war and led a determined raid into the kingdom starting in 1482.  Isabella often took it upon herself to rally her soldiers by praying in the middle of the battlefield, and even built her stronghold outside the city of Granada in the shape of a cross, believing she was doing God's will.  Eventually Isabella's forces were victorious and she signed the Treaty of Granada, ending the Reconquista after 700 years of fighting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Earlier in her reign, Isabella had been approached by a young explorer by the name of Christopher Columbus, who sought funding for a new expedition to reach the Indies by sailing west.  Her advisors judged his plan impractical and believed that his proposed distance to Asia was much too short to be possible.  However, instead of turning him out as Portugal had done, Isabella gave him a small annual allowance and free lodging in all her cities.  He continued to try and sell his plan to the monarchs, and they continued to decline.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Upon returning from Granada, Isabella was again approached by Christopher Columbus.  On the advice of her confessor, Isabella this time firmly turned him down.  As Columbus was leaving Crdoba in despair, Ferdinand quickly convinced Isabella to change her mind.  She sent a royal guard to fetch him and began to draw up plans for funding.  Columbus left on his fateful voyage on August 3, 1492, and landed in America on October 12. Isabella and Ferdinand's patronage of the intrepid explorer began Spain's Golden Age of exploration and colonization.</Text>

			<Text>The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Spain (or more succinctly, the Spanish Inquisition) was established in 1478 by Isabella to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in Castile and Aragon, and to replace the Medieval Inquisition currently under Papal control.  However, in 1492, it took a turn for the worse.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A Dominican friar, Toms de Torquemada became the first Inquisitor General and pushed the two monarchs to pursue a more active policy of religious unity.  While Isabella was loathe to take harsh measures against the Jews in her kingdom (for purely economic reasons), Torquemada was able to convince Ferdinand and through him, Isabella.  The Alhambra Decree was signed on March 31, 1492, calling for the forced expulsion of the Jews. About 200,000 Jews immediately left Spain while  some others converted, but this latter group fell under strict scrutiny of the Inquisition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Muslims in the Granada region, who had originally been granted religious freedoms, were pressured to convert.  After many Muslims revolted, a policy was enacted to force conversion or expulsion, much like with the Jews.</Text>

			<Text>Isabella continued to stabilize her growing empire throughout her reign, and worked to link her children with other European nations, hoping to avoid another succession war similar to her own.  She strived to finally unite the Iberian Peninsula under one crown. She married her eldest son to an Austrian Archduchess, establishing a link to the Habsburgs, and her eldest daughter to Manual I of Portugal. However, Isabella's plans were laid to waste when both children died soon after and the crown passed to her third daughter, Joanna the Mad. Joanna married Philip of Burgundy and became the last Trastmaran monarch.   After her, the crown passed to the Habsburgs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Isabella died in 1504 and was entombed in the Royal Chapel of Granada.</Text>

Although many criticize her role in the Inquisition and in the persecution of Jews and Muslims, others are currently campaigning to have the late Queen canonized as a Saint in the Catholic Church.

Growing from pre-agricultural communities into vast urban centers, the Maya city-states came to rely on sophisticated farming techniques for both sustenance and trade.

An impressively complex system, the Long Count calendar was one of three used by the Maya, the others being the Haab and the Tzolkin.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Source of the 2012 doomsday predictions, the Long Count calendar was used by the Maya as a historical record of time since the creation of the human world. By this calendar, civilization began on August 11th, 3114 BC, and, as selectively interpreted by those who choose to believe in our impending doom, ends on December 21st, 2012. These doomsayers believe that the Maya foretold the end of the world through the calendar, but most researchers simply interpret it as the end of one cycle and the beginning of another, not a cataclysmic end to the world as we know it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Used in conjunction with the Long Count calendar, the lesser-known Haab was a 365-day calendar that approximated a single solar-year, while the Tzolkin calendar followed a 260 day system used to judge harvest and ritual times.</Text>

			<Text>The arrival of the Spanish quickly led to the demise of the remaining northern Maya cities, and although the Maya people still exist today in Mexico and other parts of Central and South America, much of their culture and history was lost during the conquest of the Conquistadores. Beginning in the early 1500s, the Spanish sent expeditions into the Yucatan Peninsula in hopes of establishing a permanent settlement. However, the decentralized nature of the Maya city-states allowed for independent resistance to the Spanish incursions, and it would take the Spanish nearly 200 years to fully subdue the Maya people throughout the area.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the subjugation of the Maya, there were various attempts to convert the populace to Roman Catholicism by the Spanish. Of these efforts, the most notorious were those undertaken by Spanish bishop Diego de Landa, who served the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatan. De Landa is said to have held an inquisition in the small settlement of Mani, where he burned Maya idols as well as rare written codices, in an attempt to root out the native religion. Although his actions are widely viewed with disdain, De Landa is noted by some historians for keeping his own detailed records of the Maya religion and language as he observed it firsthand traveling among them.</Text>

			<Text>Various theories exist as to the origin of the Maya people, and it's only within the last 50 years that archaeologists studying Mesoamerica have managed to piece together a timeline of their early civilization. Breakthroughs in deciphering the Mayan script during the 1960s and 70s led to a revival in the study of Maya history, which had previously been mired in conjecture due to the lack of written records.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maya civilization is categorized into several distinct cycles, the Pre-Classic, Classic, and Post-Classic periods. Beginning in the Pre-Classic period, the first settlements are thought to have formed between 2000-1500 BC, when the earliest Maya began to transition from a strictly hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a more community-focused agricultural subsistence. Over time these early communities would evolve into an increasingly complex society, not only implementing advanced agricultural practices and trade networks, but also creating grand works of art and architecture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The height of Maya civilization occurred from roughly 250 AD to 900 AD, during a time known as the Classic period. During the Classic period, the Maya developed some of their best known hallmarks, moving towards large independent city-states, each with vast urban centers teeming with monuments to their gods and kings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Post-Classic period began with the decline of major urban centers throughout the southern Maya territory, an unexplained collapse that led to the complete abandonment of some of their greatest cities.

			<Text>Although the immense cities of the Maya were united by a shared culture, they were also fiercely independent, invariably going to war with one another over territory, trade, and political disputes. Despite this independence, all of the great Maya cities shared a role in influencing their culture as a whole, as each contributed the unique characteristics that defined them as individuals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Believed to be the longest inhabited settlement found anywhere in the Americas, Kaminaljuyu was home to a large Maya population from roughly 1500 BC until about 1200 AD. Dozens of archaeological excavations at the site over the past century have revealed that the city may have been the primary producer of obsidian and jade in the region, and the remnants of more than 100 mounds and ancient structures have been discovered. Unfortunately, commercial construction and development of the surrounding area during the 19th and 20th centuries has all but destroyed the remains of this once great city, leaving only fragments behind.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El Mirador, flourishing from roughly 600 BC until 100 AD, was another great city of the Maya. A settlement of significant size, El Mirador is noted for its numerous elevated roadways, known to the Maya as the "Sacbe." Used to connect structures within the settlement complex as well as distant trade centers, the sacbe were a crucial mechanism in establishing the Maya trade networks. Similar to modern causeways that are raised over stretches of unstable land, the sacbe covered vast expanses, the longest connecting the ancient city of Coba with the smaller settlement of Yaxuna some 60 miles (96 km) away.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps the best known of the Classic Maya cities, Tikal, served as capital of the powerful Tikal state, an ambitious and aggressive state that often initiated fierce battles against its neighboring rivals. Tikal is thought to have been occupied for nearly 2,000 years, and was home to some 100,000 people at its peak. One of the lesser known innovations found at Tikal, the "Aguada," was an ingenious system of water reservoirs, designed to harvest and collect rain water funneled from the plaster walls of the city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chitzen Itza was one of the last surviving Mayan settlements, and as such it's also one of the best preserved of their cities. With extensive constructions covering an area over 2.5 sq. miles (6.5 sq. km), Chitzen Itza features prominent examples of nearly every form of Maya architecture including massive step pyramids, multiple ball courts, and ornately-decorated temples.</Text>

			<Text>Approaching the 9th century, many of the southernmost Maya settlements entered a period of swift decline for reasons still unknown today. Labeled the Classic Maya collapse, the dissolution and abandonment of these great kingdoms is the subject of controversy. Overpopulation, environmental damage, warfare and disease all stand as plausible theories on their own, but it seems most likely that within the larger city-states a combination of these factors led to their abandonment.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the mysterious collapse mainly effected the settlements in the southern Maya territory, many of the northern city-states continued to prosper well into the second millennium AD. Marking the beginning of the Post-Classic period, it wasn't until after the collapse that the famous city of Chitzen Itza first rose to prominence. Chitzen Itza survived for several hundred years before falling into a ruinous civil war with the neighboring Mayapan in the 1300s. Mayapan, along with Uxmal and Coba, were among the few remaining Maya cities in the north, post-collapse.</Text>

			<Text>Although the Maya were never unified as a single empire, instead living in city-states similar to the ancient Greeks, each independent state still followed a similar class structure. Beginning around the 3rd century BC, the Maya were ruled by hereditary succession, unless a suitable heir was unavailable. The king was joined by his family and other high ranking citizens to form the upper class of nobility. Beneath the nobles, the priestly class of shamans made up the next tier, guiding the Maya kings and leading the people through the many rituals and ceremonial rites undertaken throughout the year. Beyond these ruling classes, the majority of the Maya were simply the "common folk"-farmers, craftsmen, and laborers. Lower still, the underclass consisted primarily of slaves, who were prisoners of war and criminals.</Text>

			<Text>While working with limited access to fresh groundwater, the Maya utilized a number of agricultural techniques that allowed them to take full benefit of the rich soil within their domain. The "Milpa" system of crop rotation, known to have been used by a variety of Mesoamerican societies, was particularly effective for the Maya. A type of slash-and-burn farming, the Milpa system involved intercropping multiple species of vegetation together followed by periods where the fields were left fallow, or unseeded. Typically this rotation period allowed for two or three years of planting, followed by six to eight years without use. The crops of the Maya farmers were primarily corn, squash, and beans, known collectively as "The Three Sisters."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Maya were not only able farmers, but also skilled hunters and fishermen. Relying on a number of tools and weapons, the Maya primarily hunted deer, rabbit, and the "peccary," a pig-like creature found in the rainforest. The Maya also utilized an innovative spear-throwing device, the Atlatl, which they used for both hunting and warfare. Using a wooden shaft with a cupped end, the spear (or dart) would be laid along its length, and, using the thrower's natural motion, the spear would be propelled at a much higher rate of speed due to the additional extension provided by the device. Spears thrown from the Atlatl are said to be capable of reaching speeds over 100 mph (160 km/h), which allowed the Maya greater confidence in stalking larger, faster prey.</Text>

			<Text>Like other polytheistic societies throughout the world, the Maya worshipped a vast pantheon of gods, led by the creator god Itzamna. Special emphasis was placed on the sky gods, particularly Kinish Ahau, the sun god, and the moon goddess, Ixchel. The Maya also had gods for the weather, their crops, and the various professions in their society. The Maya maize god was of particular importance once the crop became a staple of survival during the later stages of their development.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Throughout the year, the Maya held a number of rituals honoring the gods, based largely on their knowledge of astronomy and the calendar.  Of the cultures that utilized human sacrifice, the Maya were far from the most prolific, but they did partake in bloodletting and sacrifice during their most important rituals. Human sacrifices were thought to have promoted fertility, and the Mayas were known to sacrifice humans by throwing them into freshwater sinkholes, honoring the rain god, Chaac. The famous Sacred Cenote, found at Chitzen Itza, was the site of numerous human sacrifices during the Classic period of Maya history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Along with many other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya played a ritualistic ballgame where they attempted to knock a solid rubber ball (weighing 5-10 lbs) through a vertically mounted hoop using their hips. The game was played both recreationally and at ceremonial events, and was also used as a competitive means of settling territorial disputes, potentially resulting in the deaths of the losing team.</Text>

			<Text>At the height of their civilization, the Maya created many great works of art featuring intricate carvings and reliefs in stone and jade, as the artisans of each city incorporated unique regional characteristics into their work. The Maya also developed a range of pigments and dyes using the available resources of the jungle, most notably the color "Maya Blue," a vivid blue tone made from indigo dye that was later adopted into the works of the European colonists, following the decline of Maya society.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Among Maya architecture, its most recognizable aspect is the step pyramid, dozens of which were constructed during the later stages of their civilization. Just as it sounds, the step pyramid consisted of layers of stone built in stepped levels cresting in a flat peak where religious ceremonies often took place. It is thought that the Mesoamerican step pyramids were built upon existing burial mounds or earlier temples, and may have been rebuilt over time based on calendar cycles. The most prominent example of the Maya step-pyramid is found at the site of Chichen Itza in the Yucatan Peninsula, a well-preserved example under the stewardship of the Mexican government.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Maya writing system, made up of a script often referred to as glyphs or hieroglyphs because of its similarity to the ancient Egyptian writing system. Found inscribed on works throughout their territory and gradually deciphered over the past century, the Maya used this script to memorialize many aspects of their culture. Although there is evidence that Maya scribes created bound volumes using bark and animal skin, much of this work was destroyed during the colonial incursions of the Spanish in the 16th century, as it was thought to be as heretical.</Text>

Beginning with the conquests of the Romans, the later rise of the Franks, and eventually the Holy Roman Empire, the Netherlands became a frequent target of expanding European kingdoms. However, none would leave a greater mark than the Spanish Habsburgs, whose persecution of Dutch Protestants under King Philip contributed directly to the outbreak of the Eighty Years' War. Pitting the Dutch citizenry against their Spanish masters in a near-century long conflict for independence, once free of Spanish rule, the people of the Netherlands worked tirelessly to establish their own national identity.

			<Text>As England grew increasingly concerned over Dutch trade with the English, French, and Spanish colonies, hampering British trade efforts and profitability, a series of acts passed by the British Parliament in 1651 sought to control the extent of Dutch shipping. Known as the Navigation Acts, these regulations sought to restrict Dutch access to the English ports. These efforts by England to control the seas led directly to a series of conflicts known as the Anglo-Dutch Wars, fought throughout the 17th century. Over the course of the next 100 years and well into the mid-1700s, Dutch power in both political circles and world trade was greatly reduced as a result of numerous naval battles that reduced the size and power of the Dutch fleet.</Text>

			<Text>Since first establishing themselves as a sovereign nation, the Dutch continually made efforts to maintain a policy of strict neutrality whenever possible. As such, the Netherlands remained neutral throughout the great conflict that was World War I, committing no arms to the fight but still maintaining economic ties with the belligerents of both sides.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During World War II, the Dutch again declared their neutrality at the outbreak of hostilities. However, this time Germany would not allow the valuable Dutch territory to remain unaligned. Invading in 1940, the Nazis faced initial resistance from the Dutch military, but the Netherlands were ultimately overrun and occupied by the Third Reich. During the German occupation, the Dutch government fled the country and operated in exile, leaving the nation under the control of Nazi forces. Although a resistance movement within the Netherlands grew as the Nazi occupation became increasingly unbearable, the Nazis were still successful in killing thousands of Dutch Jews as well as Jewish exiles from Germany, including Anne Frank, whose diary has become a widely read chronicle of the Holocaust.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1944, in an effort to seize control of the bridges leading from the Netherlands to Germany over the Rhine and Maas rivers, the Allies launched one of the largest airborne missions in history, known as Operation Market Garden. The allies dropped thousands of paratroopers into the region, but the mission was met with limited success. Allied commanders blamed poor weather and communication issues with hampering the allied push. As a result, the Netherlands remained under the grip of the Nazi regime until the eventual surrender of German forces in the spring of 1945.</Text>

Of these tribes, the Batavi, who lived on an island along the Rhine River, were among the most powerful and feared.

Although these tribal groups had lived throughout the area for centuries, with the absence of the once powerful Romans, the opportunity for their expansion was now greatly increased. The Empire of the Franks eventually encompassed nearly all of the Netherlands and Germany, except for the Frisian Kingdom situated along the northern coast. Living in such close confines, the Franks and Frisians eventually became bitter rivals, settling their territorial disputes through a series of wars. In 734, the Franks' victory at the Battle of the Boarn marked the dissolution of the Frisian Kingdom and their absorption into the Frankish Empire.

As William was a Dutch nobleman, and served Spain as a loyal subject, he was initially hesitant to defy the king.

He also created a separate branch of power for both the priesthood and army, forming one of the first systems of checks and balances.

To ensure the continuation of his empire, he displaced hundreds of thousands of people, relocating them about the empire as he saw fit.  Despite any faults, Pachacuti began the Incans largest era of conquest, expanding their empire until it dominated nearly all of the known, inhabited South America.</Text>

Generally the privateer worked alone, but sometimes they banded together to form larger fleets, in order to take down some of the heavier marks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The privateer's aim wasn't to sink the enemy vessel - only to capture it and its goods.

			<Text>Spain's location on the Iberian Peninsula between North Africa and Europe has made it an important territory from prehistoric times to the present.  At one time the first world Imperial power, Spain later had to survive devastating wars and centuries of political unrest. From its discovery and colonization of the New World to its involvement in countless wars of independence, Spain is one of the few countries which can claim such a lasting and encompassing global influence.</Text>

			<Text>The Kingdom of Spain is the 51st largest country in the world, only some 31,000 square miles bigger than the state of California.  The majority of the country is dominated by high plateaus and mountain ranges, including the Sierra Nevada in the south and the Pyrenees to the west.  Spain's highest peak is located on one of its island holdings, the volcano Teide on Tenerife, a member of the Canary Islands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Spain's climate is incredibly diverse, even if only considering the mainland and none of the colonies.  The southern areas bordering the Mediterranean Sea enjoy a mild Mediterranean and semi-arid climate, the central plain is Continental in nature, and the northern areas vary between Oceanic and Mountainous temperatures.  Also, contrary to popular belief, the rain in Spain does not fall mainly in the plain - it's usually found in the mountains.</Text>

			<Text>Archeological evidence suggests that humans first arrived on the Iberian Peninsula about 32,000 years ago, the Altamira cave paintings providing a famous artifact of their travels. The peninsula was settled between two main groups, the Iberians and the Celts, the former populating the southern and eastern areas with the latter inhabiting the northern and western stretches.  The peninsula placed the Celts and Iberians in a prime position for commerce, and many Phoenician and Greek merchants set up a thriving gold and silver trade, predominately within the city of Tartessos, located at present-day Seville.  A few Phoenician, Greek, and Carthaginian trading colonies were founded along the Mediterranean coast of the peninsula, though the local populace retained control over most of their area, despite this influx of foreign gold and power.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_NEWWORLD_SCENARIO_CIV5_SPAIN_TEXT_4">
			<Text>This continued until roughly 210 BC, when the Romans captured the Carthaginian colonies during the Second Punic War.  At this point, the Romans launched a campaign into the heart of the Iberian Peninsula, where they conquered nearly all of the landmass. Over the course of the next 500 years, the Celts and Iberians were steadily "Romanized" - local aristocratic families were inducted into the Roman nobility, Roman roads and trading posts dotted the land, and new systems of irrigation techniques were established, including the famous aqueducts.   Christianity was also introduced during this time and was quickly adopted by the local people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rome, however, began to lose hold of the peninsula (now being referred to as "Hispania" or "Iberia") when a Germanic invasion of Gaul pushed Suevi and Vandal peoples into Iberia in 409 AD. The displaced tribes set up a new kingdom in modern day Galicia and Portugal, and Rome lacked the resources to stop them.  The Vandals quickly spread across Iberia, leaving the Romans with a small southern holding along the coast, Spania.  The Byzantine Romans hoped to retake Iberia from this vantage point, but soon the entire peninsula fell under Visigothic rule.</Text>

			<Text>The Visigoths continued their control of Iberia for the next three centuries, until a sudden invasion by the Umayyad Islamic Empire swept across the peninsula.  The large, Moorish armies crossed from North Africa into Gibraltar and conquered nearly the whole of Iberia in seven short years, from 711-718 AD.   The new Islamic powers allowed the Christians and the Jews to continue their religious practices, but did require them to pay special taxes and submit to a few discriminatory practices. Despite these minor (for the given time) prejudices, many of the locals began to convert to Islam.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The invaders themselves were hardly unified despite their shared religion and purpose, and soon groups of Moors were splitting off and forming settlements of their own, primarily in the Valencia and Granada regions.  In the 11th century the Muslim territories fractured again, allowing some of the remaining Christian kingdoms to expand their boundaries.  Christians and Muslims continued to wrest for control of Iberia for centuries, resulting in the creation of the Reconquista.</Text>

			<Text>Officially starting with the Battle of Covadonga in 722 (but not gaining momentum until much later), the Reconquista was the name given to the Christians' attempt to reclaim Iberia from Muslim rule.  Many important Christian kingdoms were founded by the Reconquista, such as Asturias and Aragon, but most of the Muslim kingdoms stubbornly held onto their land.  For the next 700 years, a battle for the Iberian Peninsula raged between the Christians and the Muslims: strongholds were built and fell, power bases and balances shifted, and borders were redrawn on nearly a yearly basis.  Despite the slow encroachment of the Christian-led kingdoms across Iberia, no clear victor presented itself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, this all changed with the fateful union of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, joined by the marriage of Isabella I and Ferdinand II in 1469.  The two monarchs led a pointed attack against the Islamic stronghold of Granada, and in 1492 they finally ended the 781-year rule of the Muslims in Iberia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1492 was an important year for the monarchs; Christopher Columbus, with the patronage of Isabella, arrived in America (leading to the colonization of the New World), and the Iberian Jews were ordered to convert to Christianity or face expulsion or even death under the Inquisition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The new, unified kingdom of Isabella and Ferdinand became known as Espaa (or Spain) and with her wealthy colonies in the New World became the first "world power" of the time.</Text>

			<Text>At its height, the Spanish Empire counted holdings across the entirety of the world - from large chunks of North and South America and small pieces of Europe, to various cities in North Africa and the entirety of the East Indies. The Spanish led the world in this age of discovery, accumulating vast amounts of wealth and trade from their numerous colonies and principalities.  It was said, and rightfully so, that the sun always shone somewhere in the Spanish Empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Spain's new trade routes with the New World not only provided new knowledge and culture, but also new resources in the form of precious metals ( i.e., gold), spices, and plants. Spain's Golden Age also saw the creation of intellectual and spiritual reforms as well, starting with the escalation of humanism, beginnings of the Protestant Reformation, and the founding of the School of Salamanca.</Text>

			<Text>With great power comes great responsibility, at least if you don't want Barbary pirates to conduct slave raids along your empire's coastal holdings. Besides the growing pirate and Ottoman threat, Spain found itself routinely at war with France.  Religious unrest and wars shook the Catholic empire, as the Protestant Reformation dragged the empire into ever-increasing military engagements across Europe.  What unrest and religion didn't touch, plague did, and in the 1650's, the empire was rocked by the Great Plague of Seville.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]From this point forward, Spain's power and influence went into a gradual, and then not-so-gradual decline. She began to lose her European holdings, primarily from the separation of Portugal and the Netherlands, and then suffered military setbacks from the highly destructive Thirty Years War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Wars and more wars threatened and decimated the once proud empire for the next two centuries.  In the 18th century, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the country by trickery, claiming he was on his way to Portugal.  Then in the early 19th century, a nationalist revolt to overthrow their French- occupationalist government led to the Spanish War of Independence, or the Peninsular War.  Despite their eventual victory over the French (mostly due to Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign) the country was thrown into political turmoil.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Spain soon saw itself in turn facing multiple wars of independence from its own foreign colonies, cumulating in the Spanish-American War. The 20th century didn't bring much change for the fallen empire - The Spanish Civil War of the 1930s brought Fascism and an authoritarian government to the country, claiming over half a million lives in the process.  This war is also commonly credited as the first battle of World War II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It wasn't until the death of General Francisco Franco, in 1975, that the monarchy was restored and things began to look up for Spain for the first time in the past 300 years.</Text>

			<Text>In its most basic form, Imperialism describes an unequal relationship between one nation and another, where the former has some amount of control over the latter country - usually in the form of some kind of empire.  Imperialistic dynasties can be found in all the histories of the world, from China to Rome to Britain, and imperialism as a concept has existed for thousands of years, just about as long as governments in general.  The term "imperialism", however, wasn't coined until the 16th century, where it was used to describe the foreign policies and proceedings of nations like Spain, Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands, as they swiftly built up imperial ties with the Americas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While Imperialism is traditionally connected with the large, iconic, militaristic empire, it can be exhibited in a much more subtle manner.  Formal control of the weaker state's government isn't always necessary, and a stronger civilization will sometimes control a weaker one purely through indirect economic, political or religious means.</Text>

			<Text>Naval Tradition describes both a civilization's dedication to sea travel and a standing navy, as well as the individual traditions and customs employed by those navies.  Many island and ocean-side civilizations like Britain and Spain have long standing naval traditions, as the ocean played a major part of their economic and political development.  While some landlocked countries employed professional soldiers to keep the peace and wage wars, naval-minded civs kept flotillas and fleets of ships rather than land-bound armies, plying the waves for enemy vessels and pirates.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Many traditions born aboard the earliest navies are still followed by sailors today, and others have expanded beyond the confines of the ship to people on land. Some practices, like wearing bellbottom pants, using decorative sleeve buttons on jackets, or "minding your P's and Q's" all have their roots in naval traditions.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_NEWWORLD_SCENARIO_TECH_PIRACY_DESC">
			<Text>Raiding, pillaging, unspeakable violence at sea - a pirate's life is a good one.  Often romanticized by popular film and media, pirates are anything but the witty, wisecracking Captain Jack Sparrows and Pirate Kings entertaining the young masses. These naval criminals took cargo by force from other ships, raided seaside towns, and were a general menace to all forms of civilized society. Piracy has probably been around for as long as civilizations have ported goods and peoples across the seas - one of the earliest records of piracy dates back to the 13th century BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some of the most famous piracy accounts are attributed to the European Vikings, who terrorized coastal villages and holdings, and the Caribbean pirates, who generally liked to seize Spanish treasure ships fat and heavy with gold.  This classic? era of piracy is the one most commonly depicted in films and books, and lasted from about 1560 to 1720.  While this illustrious pirate with saber sword and jaunty hat is relegated now to the work of fiction, piracy is still found rampant in many waters, especially off the coast of the Arabian Peninsula.   Piracy however should not be confused or interchanged with the act of privateering, a form of naval raiding authorized by a legal government, usually for wartime benefit.</Text>

These fulltime soldiers are better-equipped, better trained, and are all-in-all more effective than your average farmer with a leather jerkin and a pitchfork.  The Roman Empire created one of the world's first standing armies staffed with professional soldiers, who were a key part to their sweeping military victories. In Europe, some of the first professional soldiers were employed by Charles VII of France in 1445, and later by King James II of Britain in 1685.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Professional soldiers are a staple part of a modern civilization's army and defense system, and can be found employed in many of the world's developed countries.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_NEWWORLD_SCENARIO_TECH_RELIGIOUS_ORDERS_DESC">
			<Text>In many world religions, there exist special communities and organizations of devout individuals who live apart from the majority of society, usually to keep more perfectly in line with their specific religious beliefs.  These religious orders often take the physical form of monasteries, a building or complex where the pious can work and live.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While some religious orders were content to reside and pray in their native countries, some instead were founded for the sole purpose of expansion and spreading their beliefs to new peoples.  The Jesuit missionaries in the Americas were one such religious order. These Jesuits traveled across the Atlantic and set up monasteries and missions on the American soil, where they taught the local people the tenets of their faith and the basics of western education.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_NEWWORLD_SCENARIO_TECH_ROYAL_GUARDS_DESC">
			<Text>Usually formed by an elite group of armed retainers, royal guards are the traditional military or ceremonial unit employed to protect royalty or important clergy.  Historically, these elite members have also served a dual political purpose, as their unique position would allow them to sway a given monarch's opinion or play a key part in any sort of coup or uprising.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some regiments of royal guards have become celebrated and well-known outside of their given countries, such as Spain's Tropas de la Casa Real and the French Musketeers. France's Musketeers were technically only a junior unit of the French Royal Guard, beneath the Garde de Corpe who actually performed most of the bodyguard responsibilities.  But thanks in part to Alexandre Dumas' work, The Three Musketeers, they have become some of the most popular and recognizable royal guards of any civilization.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_NEWWORLD_SCENARIO_TECH_TREASURE_FLEET_DESC">
			<Text>Once the Spanish arrived in the Americas and began shipping their new finds and treasures back to Europe, they needed to develop a new, more efficient method of sailing in order to combat the increased pressure of pirate raids on their ships.  The Spanish Treasure Fleet was the answer - a special convoy system of ships which was strictly regulated in both docking and sailing practices.  Ships departing from the Americas along the Spanish Main were instructed to sail en masse along a specific sea lane, allowing them to be more easily protected by a smaller armed force.  These ships then only sailed to restricted, protected, port towns (like Seville), again lessening the risk of pirate raid.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Treasure Fleet was employed by Spain from the 16th to 18th century with much success, and is still counted as one of the most profitable and effective naval operations in history. However, the loss of some important coastal cities along the Spanish Main in the 1700s began to threaten the continued existence of the fleet.  In a bid to combat this, King Charles III loosened the rigorous system in 1765, and gave more colonies access to the fleet in the 1780s.  However, the last full fleet sailed in 1790 and shipping between the two continents was relegated to smaller groups of ships on an as-needed basis.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_NEWWORLD_SCENARIO_TECH_WARSHIPS_DESC">
			<Text>While many ships are engineered to cross oceans quickly or take the greatest amount of cargo in the smallest possible space, warships were designed for one purpose alone - destroying other ships.  Besides obviously being armed with some form of weapon (traditionally things like cannon or rams), warships can also withstand more damage and are much more maneuverable than something like a merchant or passenger vessel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As naval technologies have advanced, so has the warship.  Galleys and triremes were early forms of warships capable of ramming enemy vessels, but usually combat was performed by the army onboard.  However, once cannon became capable of quick reloads, large sail-driven ships were employed which held rows of cannon along each side of the craft. Eventually these wooden ships were given up for ones made of iron and steel, and sails were abandoned for steam and nuclear power. While modern warships bear little resemblance to the earliest galleys, they still keep to the same basic design principles - be capable of destroying the other guy first, before he can take out you.</Text>

These ships followed a precise path each time they crossed the Atlantic to Spain, allowing themselves to be easily protected from pirates and thieves.

Each has a special ability.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Your civilization acquires Great People by constructing certain buildings and wonders, and then staffing them with "specialists", citizens from your cities who have given up working in the field or the mines. While specialists do not work city tiles, they do greatly speed the arrival of Great People. Balancing the need for production and food and the desire for Great People is an important challenge of city management.</Text>

For that reason, the Bolsheviks argued in 1917 that a vanguard party of bureaucrats would head a centralized political party that administered the new Soviet Russia. In time, with the spread of the communist revolution throughout the industrial world, the need for a party leadership would wither and it would be dissolved; history proved otherwise.</Text>

The term, according to the Oxford Dictionary, was first used in 1851 in several obscure German tracts; in the 1930s it came to be used in the press to describe the totalitarian and communistic governments of the time.</Text>

			<Text>Mercenaries - those who take part in a conflict for personal gain or compensation rather than duty or belief - have been a fact of war since ancient times; but the practice reached its height during the Renaissance, when the so-called "Free Companies" were formed to fight for hire. Often composed of veterans from national armies and led by a charismatic commander such as the Englishman Sir John Hawkwood, who formed the infamous White Company, these were usually hired during times of war by city-states or small kingdoms that lacked the funds or manpower to maintain standing armies. While some of the early mercenary forces specialized in specific forms of combat - for instance, cavalry or artillery companies - most were formed of German or Swiss landsknecht and saw extensive use during the religious wars of the Reformation. Coincidentally, to the south the condottieri served in the internecine wars between the Italian city-states, including the Papacy. As late as the 1700s Scots-Gaelic Gallowglass companies were available for hire to continental nobles. In modern times, mercenaries tend to be hired in small, elite teams for specific missions, or be part of private security companies.</Text>

At the height of the Tu'i Tongan power, Fiji was well within their sphere of influence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the 19th century, Fiji was rife with inter-tribal civil wars and invasions from nearby Tonga. The Fijian chief Seru Epenisa Cakobau tried to consolidate himself as king, and used Christian missionaries (he was Christian himself) to try to extend his power. Cakobau ran into trouble by provoking the US consul, selling lands to Australian cotton farmers, and racking up a number of debts. Cakobau eventually ceded his territory to the British in 1874.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first interim British governor passed a series of uniquely enlightened rules, including a "Fiji for the Fijians" policy which resulted in natives retaining control of most of the island land. Indentured laborers from India came with British Colonial rule (until many, including Mahatma Ghandi agitated for the policy to end), adding a new dimension to the culture of the island that persists in Fiji to today.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fiji was granted independence in 1970.

To counter this, the Allies launched an immense combined-arms operation to take the airfield and island, and then to hold their own gains after Japanese reinforcements began to stream into the theater.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although the name of Guadalcanal is losing its prominence in history, there are many great stories and events of that campaign: The US Marine's tenacious defense of Lunga Field against superior odds, the Tokyo Express pouring down the slot, future US President John F. Kennedy's ill-fated PT-109 - all these are part of the story of Guadalcanal, and the interested student of history is eagerly encouraged to learn more about them!</Text>

			<Text>Human beings  have lived on the Kiribati islands for at least 700 years, and possibly much longer - the exact dating of arrival is difficult due to incomplete archeological records and oral history. Probably settled by the Lapitans, Kiribati's location near the middle of the Pacific also brought it into contact with Melanesians from Fiji and Polynesians from Samoa and Tonga.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Contact with the West occurred sometime in the 16th century, and trade with the West precipitated local tribal wars that quickly became an excuse for colonial powers to gain control of the land. The bulk of the Kirabati islands became possessions of the British.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Japanese seized Kiribati during World War II, and proceeded to fortify the island. The Battle of Tarawa was one of the bloodiest battles between the US and the Japanese in the Pacific, as 4,500 Japanese soldiers converted that tiny atoll into a massive fortress, inflicting huge losses on the invading US Marines before being all but annihilated.</Text>

It was settled by Micronesians and Polynesians, seized by the colonial powers of the world, and occupied by the Japanese during World War II, though this island fortress was bypassed by the Americans in the Pacific campaign.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nauru's most abundant natural resource was its immense deposits of phosphates. When Nauru regained control of their mineral rights in the 1960s, the mining operation was nationalized and for a brief, shining moment, Nauru's citizens enjoyed the highest per-capita income in the world. But the phosphate reserves ran out, the money was invested in a series of failed ventures, and Nauru suddenly found itself out of money and with a devastated ecosystem. Since then, The Nauruese have experimented with making the island a tax haven and prison for other nations, in an effort to revive their flagging economy.</Text>

The first westerner to find Vanuatu was the Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernandes de Queiros, who claimed the land for Spain and named it "Espirtu Santo." De Bougainville visited the island in 1768, and Cook named the island the New Hebrides in 1774.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As with many Polynesian islands, contact with the west resulted in massive deaths due to new diseases, and a crush of immigrants looking to get rich off the island's Sandalwood trade exacerbated the problems. After sandalwood, speculative plantations for cotton, coffee, cocoa, and bananas were thrown up, until some degree of economic stability was achieved in coconuts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Colonialism had a heavy hand in Vanuatu until World War II, when the Americans arrived. The affluent, highly informal Americans made a huge impression on the Vanuatans, as did the constant stream of airplanes and ships that supplied the soldiers and sailors.

The relative size of these two islands is thus easily inferred. Weather is warm and mild year-round, and Tahiti sits near the Eastern edge of Polynesia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As it is one of the Easternmost islands of Polynesia, Tahiti was not settled until relatively late - somewhere between 300 and 800 AD by the Polynesians, long after the decline of the Lapitan civilization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first undisputed westerners to visit Tahiti were the English, in 1767. The English were immediately impressed with the relaxed, open, and generous nature of the islanders. Introduced diseases nearly wiped out the Tahitians, and missionaries discouraged the practice of most traditional culture, though they did document and preserve the native dialect. Charles Darwin visited Tahiti as part of his voyage on HMS Beagle. The French annexed Tahiti in 1847, but the Tahitians were not granted full French citizenship until 1946.

			<Text>Tonga is one of the larger cultural groupings within Polynesia, and has vied with the other regions for supremacy of the Pacific islands. Tonga reached its zenith as a regional power in the 14th century, during which time it achieved something of a regional hegemony of chiefs and navigators. The archipelago of the Kingdom of Tonga consists of 176 islands scattered over 700,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean, northeast of New Zealand and southwest of the Hawaiian Islands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is difficult to date the arrival of humans to the Tongan archipelago. The oldest unambiguous site is found in the village of Pea on Tongatapu, and is approximately 3,000 years old. Ceramic evidence from the Lapita period has been found in Tonga, but that would have represented a considerable feat of navigation for that civilization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]First contact with the West was recorded by the Dutch in 1616, though the most famous meeting would have been during James Cook's survey of the Pacific. Cook named Tonga "the Friendly Islands" for the hospitality of the Tongans. Curiously enough, the Tongans appear to have been planning to kill Cook, though they could not agree on a plan to do so and Cook departed unmolested and apparently oblivious to his near-miss. European missionaries extensively Christianized the Tongans during the end of the 18th and early 19th century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tonga was plunged into a fifty-year civil war following the assassination of a major chief in 1799. But in 1845, the warrior Taufa'ahau claimed the title of prime chief, and had himself baptized King George Tupou I. He then proceeded to emancipate the lowest social caste, create a code of laws, and limited the power of the other chiefs, signing an alliance with the British under the Treaty of Friendship. Tonga never became a full British colony, retaining autonomy and enjoying the military protection of the British. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tonga's position as a crossroads of the South Pacific made it a region of strategic importance during World War II. Tongan soldiers fought in the Solomon Islands, and the island of Tongatapu became a critical stop for supplies crossing from North America to New Zealand and Australia. Today Tonga is an independent, constitutional monarchy (the only Polynesian group never to have abandoned the monarch), embracing democratic reform and modernizing its government.</Text>

On islands without large forests, stone carving usually featured prominently. In addition to human tiki figures, many Polynesian islands feature petroglyphs of various styles. The most famous example of Polynesian stone carving is the massive Moai of Rapa Nui (Easter Island). These 887 stone statues were carved from the volcanic rock of Rapa Nui with simple lithic tools and moved for miles by scores of workers to their ahu platforms, from whence they could gaze inland at Rapa Nui in an awesome display of mana.</Text>

			<Text>Aquaculture is the cultivation of aquatic plants and animals in much the same way that land-living plants and animals are cultivated by agriculture. Aquaculture is primarily a source of food for people living near bodies of water, but aquaculture also includes cultivation of luxury items such as pearls and ornamental fish.  Large-scale fishing in the wild is not considered aquaculture, nor is the worthy hobby of recreational angling. Aquaculture is often used by maritime people as a way to provide a more reliable supply of marine life for food, usually supplementing various means of gathering from the wild.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aquaculture was discovered independently several times through the course of human history. The earliest archeological evidence for aquaculture may be from the indigenous Gunditjmara people of Australia, who captured and raised eels. The Polynesians created rock-walled fishponds along island shorelines, capturing fish that entered through sluice gates.  Though aquaculture never supplanted agriculture as a source of food, knowledge of aquacultural practices such as capturing wild adult fish, harvesting eggs, raising fry, and shellfish bedding spread widely across the world.  Aquaculture has also led to the introduction of many species to new environments, sometimes to the consternation of the animals and plants that were there already.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since the Industrial Age, there has been increasing interest in the commercial possibilities of aquaculture.  As commercial fishing depletes wild stocks, aquaculture of popular food fish and shellfish has ensured a reliable supply to the world's table, where the butter sauce and lemon awaits.</Text>

			<Text>Polynesian culture lacked a widespread indigenous written language, and was transmitted orally and through a variety of mnemonic methods, including ceremonial dance and singing. Dances varied from region to region in Polynesia. Ceremonial dances accompanied fertility rituals, were used to honor the gods, praise the chief and heroes, and greet esteemed visitors. Contact with the West often led to western instruments and musical styles being blended into existing dances.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most famous Polynesian ceremonial dances are probably the Hula, developed on Hawaii, and the Maori Haka of New Zealand. Hula is famous for its undulating chants and gestures, and Haka for its energetic stamps, movement, and rhythmic chants. Hulas are classified into two broad categories: Ancient, referring to pre-Western contact, and called "kahiko", and a more modern style from the 19th and 20th centuries, called 'Auana. The Haka was danced by both Maori men and women, from occasions ranging from funerals to war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dancing is still an important part of Polynesian culture and taught throughout Polynesia, allowing future generations to experience the culture through the graceful motions and harmonies of its more peaceful manifestations, as well as the powerful, aggressive greetings of rugby teams.</Text>

No matter the material, be it shell, bone, wood, or stone, the Polynesians turned what they had at hand into exceptional ornaments.  Carving was not reserved for ceremonial and religious implements; even simple daily tools from stools to spoons and house beams were carved, often in meticulous detail.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though carving was common across all of Polynesia, local styles and preferred carving materials varied significantly.  For example, Hawaii boasted a ready supply of timber, and wood carving reached significant technical skill and detail, whereas the residents of tree-less Easter Island carved the island's volcanic stones into the awesome and justifiably famous Moai.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tiki statues, stylized human figures, were among the most common carvings made.  The figures were to represent heroes or ancestors, and were believed to be imparted with the divine power of mana, with wide eyes representing awareness and bared teeth demonstrating power and defiance.  Only after World War II did "tiki" acquire its meaning as a lowbrow art form.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition to the ornamental carving of objects, the Polynesians left a variety of petroglyphs on the rocks of their islands.  These petroglyphs and the enigmatic proto-script of the Rongo-Rongo tablets are still today a subject of intense discussion and occasional conspiracy theory.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_POLYNESIAN_SCENARIO_TECH_TATTOO_DESC">
			<Text>Tattooing is the art of creating indelible patterns in ink on the body of a person, carried to a high degree of sophistication and meaning among the Polynesians. The first reference to the word is from the British naturalist Joseph Banks aboard the "Endeavor" in 1769, and derives from the Polynesian word "tatau."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Polynesian tattooing was extensive, often covering large expanses of the body. Maori and Western Polynesian tattooing often included elaborate facial tattoos. Tattoos were often tied to social rank and status, with the most intricate and involved tattoos being reserved for chiefs and leaders. The designs were predominately geometric patterns of lines and were thought to have spiritual meaning for the bearer. The Polynesian process of tattooing involved tapping a wide, sharp comb made of sharpened boar's teeth into the skin and a dye made of soot of burned lama nuts. Modern tattooing methods are considered the direct descendants of the Polynesian process for tattooing, with more sophisticated tools and absolutely no reduction in pain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A young adult undergoing tattooing would have the process conducted over a number of sessions in a span of days. Men's tattooing was generally more ritualized than women's, and the subject could reject the tattoo or break off the session, though usually at the costs of significant social stigma.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_POLYNESIAN_SCENARIO_TECH_WAYFINDING_DESC">
			<Text>Traditional Polynesian navigation, also called "wayfinding", was a highly sophisticated and orally-transmitted system of knowledge which allowed the Polynesians to cross immense expanses of the Pacific Ocean in open craft. It consisted of parts celestial navigation, awareness of oceanic currents, bird and fish behavioral sciences, dead reckoning and weather observations. Wayfinding was the exclusive and secret purview of the guilds of navigators, and allowed the Polynesians to travel across tens of thousands of square miles without use of compass or clock. An apprentice navigator would learn key facts about the motion of stars, the behavior of birds, and peculiarities of weather (such as clouds visibly forming over an island beyond the horizon) from his master in the form of chants, songs, and schematic maps created from simple materials.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As wayfinding was an orally-transmitted secret with much local variation, most knowledge of wayfinding has been lost in the present day. There are still schools of traditional Polynesian navigation in the Pacific area, such as Taumako in the Solomon Islands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Given the comparatively small size of Polynesian sail craft and the feats of sailing accomplished by the Polynesians, the efficacy of wayfinding and the skill of Polynesian navigators have been highly praised by many, occasionally straying into romantic over-embellishment. Still, it is hard not to be struck with respect at the confidence and competence that led the Polynesians to sail off towards tiny, distant islands in an open boat scarcely the length of a city bus.</Text>

As the central figure of Buddhism, Buddha was not recognized as a god, nor did he presume to claim a connection to God. Rather, Buddha taught his followers a path to enlightenment based on his own life experience, a distinction that differentiates Buddhism from many of the world's major religions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Buddhism's primary tenets, the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, lay out the means by which one can achieve Nirvana, or peace from unending suffering. In their simplest form, the Four Noble Truths tell us that life is suffering, that suffering arises from our attachment to desires, that suffering ceases when attachment to desire ceases, and that freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the eightfold path. As the name implies, there are eight aspects to the Eightfold Path, each describing the practice required to fully understand the Four Noble Truths.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the present-day, there are three major schools of Buddhism. The largest, Theravada and Mahayana, are known as sutric schools, and they believe that the primary means of attaining enlightenment is through the careful study of Buddha's teachings. The third, Vajrayana, is a tantric school, meaning they believe they can accelerate the process of enlightenment through the use of yoga, mantras, and other rituals.</Text>

The belief system of Christianity is based upon the teachings of Jesus Christ, who lived from approximately 6 BC to 30 AD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Adherents of Christianity believe that Jesus was the Son of God, who was brought to the world to teach mankind the way to salvation. Jesus' birth to the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem is recorded in the New Testament of the Bible, as are the details of his early life, living and teaching in the area of present-day Israel and Palestine. During his time spreading the word of God, Jesus is said to have performed miracles as he taught his followers how to purify themselves of sin. Giving sight to the blind, curing the sick, and turning water into wine were all miracles said to have been performed by Jesus. His eventual betrayal by Judas and his crucifixion by the Romans served only to spread his renown, as his disciples claimed that he appeared before them three days after his death, rising from the grave and ascending to heaven.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The largest schools of Christianity are Roman Catholicism, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Protestantism.

			<Text>Confucianism is a religion based on the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius, who was born in 551 BC. Originally introduced as an ethical and social philosophy, Confucianism has grown to a following of several million in the present-day, mainly concentrated in the regions of East Asia. During his life, Confucius hoped to instill a strong belief in personal morality, social responsibility, and family loyalty, as each person served their role in society. As a humanist philosophy, Confucianism focuses on the ability of every human being to learn, grow, and improve through ethical behavior and consideration for others.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following Confucius' death in approximately 479 BC, his teachings saw widespread growth for nearly 200 years until attempts at suppressing the philosophy were undertaken in earnest by the Qin Dynasty. The Qin rulers believed that Confucianism was a direct threat to their authority, and, as a result, they had most Confucian books burned, including many of Confucius' original writings. Temples were also destroyed across the country, leaving little sanctuary for the followers of Confucianism. Despite these attempts to wipe out the Confucian belief system, a hidden store of Confucian manuscripts was discovered in the walls of a scholar's home, and the religion found new life after the fall of the Qin in 206 BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the present-day, the works of Confucianism are studied by scholars throughout the world.

With over one billion followers throughout the world today (most being concentrated in India), Hinduism also has one of the largest followings of any major religion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although Hinduism cannot be attributed to a single founder, the religion has grown on the basis of the writings found in the Vedas, which focus on a single, unifying force that governs all aspects of our existence. Although there are a number of widely recognizable gods within Hinduism, notably Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma, these deities are all but a small part of the greater God. Dharma, or the "Ultimate Reality," is the universal power or law by which all things that exist are bound. Through endless cycles of death and rebirth, Hindus believe that the only means of breaking free from unending reincarnation is through meditation and the realization that God is in all things. Hindus also believe in Karma, by which our deeds, both good and bad, have a cause and effect relationship on how our lives progress.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although there are a number of competing sects within Hinduism and the schools may differ in their interpretation of the ancient manuscripts, they do not view each other as rivals, and in fact share ideas and opinions openly amongst one another.</Text>

The most important of these prophets, Muhammad, recorded God's words in the Muslim holy book, the Koran.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Born in the city of Mecca (in modern Saudi Arabia) in 570 AD, Muhammad was raised as a merchant and later worked as a shepherd. However, at age 40, he experienced visions from God, and recorded God's word verbatim in the Koran. From this point forward, Muhammad preached the word of God and instructed his followers that the only true path to salvation was to devote themselves entirely to God through daily prayer, and the strict adherence to the laws set forth by God. The Five Pillars of Islam, the framework through which salvation can be attained, state in their most basic form that there is no god but God, and Muhammad is his prophet; one must pray daily to God at the five established times; one must give to the needy to support them; one must fast from dawn until dusk during the month of Ramadan; and one must make a pilgrimage to Mecca, at least once, during the holy month of Dhu al-Hijjah.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As was the case with the founding of many religions, Muhammad and his followers were met by staunch resistance from other faiths. Despite this, Muhammad's message spread across the Middle East following his death in 632 AD. Since that time, Islam has splintered into a number of competing branches, the largest being the Sunni and Shia denominations.

The goal of Orthodox Christians is to draw nearer to God throughout their lives through theosis, a spiritual pilgrimage to become more "Christ-like."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The church traces its roots to the Great Schism. During the 9th and 10th centuries AD the Christian church under the Patriarch of Constantinople made significant conversions among the peoples of eastern Europe, including Kievan Russia and the Balkans. Doctrinal issues such as the filioque split and the authority of the Pope over the Patriarch in matters religious, exacerbated by the political and economic rivalry of Rome and Constantinople, led to a schism. The final breach between these two branches of Christianity is acknowledged as the sacking of Constantinople by the Catholic crusaders in 1204 AD. Moreover, after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, the Eastern Church became even more isolated from Rome under the relatively tolerant rule of the Turks. The Orthodox Church, which saw itself as the true heir to the teachings and practices of the early Christians, flourished under the Russian Tsars. Although somewhat diminished by Communist rule and Balkan secularism, Eastern Orthodoxy has experienced a resurgence in recent decades and remains a vital aspect of Christianity.</Text>

Zhang Daoling, the first "Celestial Master," founded the first school of Tao based on the works of Lao-Tsu.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Quickly gaining converts as he preached the philosophies of Lao-Tsu, Zhang Daoling spread the basic doctrine of Tao. One of the religion's best known aspects, Yin and Yang, represent the world filled with complimentary forces in harmony and balance, a common example being light and dark. Followers of Taoism are encouraged to exercise humility, kindness, and compassion in their daily lives in order to maintain this balance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Throughout its history, Taoism has had many sects and branches split from the original school, as elements of Chinese tradition crept into the philosophy. Magic, alchemy, and other mystical forces have all been included in some forms of Taoist thought since its early days. Although estimates of the total number of Taoist followers vary widely, it is believed that there are still several million believers living in China and the surrounding regions today.</Text>

			<Text>The ancient religion of Tengriism is notably tied to the tribal peoples of Central Asia, including the Huns and Mongols. Based primarily on the belief in Tengri, the Sky God, and Eje, the Earth Mother, Tengriism is known to have been loosely collaborated, with no priests or clerics, and no attempts to convert others. By focusing on maintaining harmony with the surrounding environment, worshippers of Tengrii held the Earth's resources sacred, particularly water, which was scarce in the steppes of Central Asia where much of Tengriism's following was found. Although it is believed there are still adherents to Tengriism in parts of Asia in the present-day, an accurate count of their numbers has not been taken.</Text>

			<Text>Zoroastrianism, an ancient religion based on the teachings of the prophet Zoroaster, is believed to have been founded some 3,500 years ago in the region surrounding modern Iran. At one time one of the largest religions in the world, Zoroastrian is only followed today by an estimated 200,000 adherents, living primarily in India, Pakistan, and Iran. Zoroastrianism is considered by some to be the oldest monotheistic religion in the world, although this is a point of contention among scholars. Zoroastrian beliefs are centered on the creator god Ahura Mazda, who is the focal point of all Zoroastrian tradition and worship. It is said that Ahura Mazda revealed his wisdom to Zoroaster, who then spread the teachings across the region. The sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, known collectively as the Avesta, contain hymns said to have been written by Zoroaster himself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As with many religions, Zoroastrianism outlines the ways in which we can live in harmony with the surrounding world, in this case through good thoughts and good actions. Zoroastrians are often mischaracterized as fire worshippers, in part because of the prevalence of fire as a symbol in Zoroastrian rituals. In Zoroastrianism, fire represents the light of Ahura Mazda, and believers will always pray in the direction of the light, rather than worshipping the fire itself.</Text>

			<Text>Despite several attempts, neither the Greeks nor the Romans managed to follow the Nile past the Sudd wetlands. Although there were accounts by Europeans visiting Ethiopia in the 1500s of a source for the great river, none were more than hearsay. In the mid-1800s, the European public became obsessed with learning where the source of the Nile might lie in the "heart of Africa." In 1858, the explore Richard Speke claimed that Lake Victoria was the source; although disputed by Sir Richard Burton and others, Henry Stanley finally confirmed Speke's claim by circumnavigating the vast lake and reporting on the outflow of Ripon Falls as the "Source of the Nile."</Text>

			<Text>Having only gained its independence in 1830 AD, Belgium was a relative late-comer to the European scramble for colonies in Africa. Although the Belgian colonial holdings included the small territories of Rwanda and Burundi, it was primarily comprised of the Belgian Congo, a vast area drained by the Congo River. Unlike most colonies, the Congo was not administered by the government, but instead was the private property of King Leopold II of Belgium. From August 1879 to June 1884, while under contract to King Leopold to navigate the river, the explorer Henry Stanley negotiated treaties with a number of tribal chieftains whereby they transferred all rights to their respective lands to the Belgian king. Leopold proceeded to establish private military posts and plantations to harvest rubber. In 1884, the Berlin Conference, headed by the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, recognized Leopold's ownership of the Congo. Leopold's brutal policies eventually led to international outcry however; in 1908, despite the aging Leopold's offers to reform his personal rule of the territory, the Belgian parliament reluctantly annexed the king's "Congo Free State" as a colony.</Text>

			<Text>"Boer" is the Afrikaans word for "farmer" which came to denote the Dutch settlers of the Cape of Good Hope and their descendants. The original Trekboers were primarily Dutch Calvinists who migrated to found settlements in South Africa during the years 1652-1795 while the area was controlled by the Dutch East Indies Company. To avoid British colonialism, most of the Boers in the Cape Colony migrated northward to establish several Boer republics. They fought two wars against the British to defend their independent countries, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. After the British victory and absorption of the two Boer republics in 1902, a Boer diaspora commenced, which saw many of the Dutch descendants migrate to Argentina, Kenya, Mexico and the southwestern United States. In 1914, the remaining Boers rose in rebellion at the outbreak of World War I; it was forcefully put down amd the ringleaders imprisoned or executed for treason. With that, the last vestiges of the Boers disappeared from history.</Text>

By this time, France, England, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands had been carving out colonies in Africa for 100 years. Looking to conquer as yet unclaimed parts of the continent, by the outbreak of World War I, Italy had annexed Eritrea, Somalia and Libya. However, it had been defeated in its first attempt to conquer Ethiopia in the war of 1895-1896; Ethiopia would not fall under Italian dominion until 1936. In 1915 Italy entered World War I on the side of the Western Allies with the agreement of Great Britain and France that it would receive significant territory in Europe and, upon the defeat of Germany, extensive lands carved from the German East African possessions. However, in the Treaty of Versailles that ended the war, Italy was given little land in Europe and none in Africa, leading to resentment towards the European colonial powers that lasted two decades.</Text>

			<Text>The three Ideology trees, Freedom, Order, and Autocracy, have greatly expanded in Brave New World. All civilizations in the game, upon reaching the Modern era or building three factories, will be required to choose an Ideology for their civilization. Each Ideology tree contains 3 tiers of "tenets" that you use to customize your Ideology, with the third and final tier holding the most powerful benefits. As with regular Social Policies, players use Culture to purchase additional tenets as they move through the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Civilizations that share a common Ideology will receive benefits with their diplomatic relationships. Civilizations that have conflicting Ideologies have multiple side-effects. For example, a negative effect on their diplomatic relationship and happiness penalties take effect if an opposing Ideology has a stronger Cultural influence on your people. If you let your people become too unhappy, there is a chance that your cities may declare that they are joining your opponents empire. As a last resort, you, or other players, can resort to a "Revolution" to switch Ideologies to one that is preferable to your people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For more information on Ideological Tenets, click on the "Social Policies" tab along the top of the Civilopedia, and scroll down to the Order, Freedom, and Autocracy sections.</Text>

			<Text>Great Artists, Engineers, Merchants and Scientists are created in cities by specialists and Wonders which generate "Great People" (GP)  points. A city may generate no Great People points, or it may generate a single kind of GP points or it may generate multiple kinds of GP points. Each city's GP points are kept track of separately. (For example, Kyoto might generate 1 Artist and 2 Engineer GP pts each turn. After 3 turns it would have 3 Artist points and 6 Engineer GP pts. The two types of points are not pooled.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When a city has enough of a specific type of GP points, the points are expended to generate a Great Person of that type. Once a Great Person is generated, the amount required for the next Great Person increases in all of that player's cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For instance, let's say that a player needs to acquire 10 GP pts to get a Great Person. From the previous example, in five turns Kyoto would have enough Engineer GP pts. to create a Great Engineer. After the Great Engineer was created, Kyoto would have 0 Great Engineer points and 5 Great Artist points left, and the amount required for the next Great Person would increase to say 15 points. Eight turns later Kyoto would have 13 Great Artist points and 16 Great Engineer points, and it would generate another Great Engineer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that a Garden building increases the rate at which you generate Great People, and that the "Warrior Code" social policy immediately generates a Great General.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Additionally, once you advance into the Industrial Age, you will be able to expend unused Faith to purchase Great People, depending on what Social Policy branches you have open.</Text>

			<Text>The exact origins of Pulias are shrouded in mystery even to this day.  It seems to have emerged out of nowhere, yet its power and wealth seem too large to have been easily missed.  Most sources posit a single leader who saw the opportunities of new science, commerce, and most of all politics, and manipulated affairs from the shadows.  This leader sold sensitive information to rivals at a premium while using it to further the objectives of Pulias.  In the early competition between empires, many opportunities were left unexplored as rivals focused on short-term gains.  Pulias was the first to send expeditions to foreign lands, and established trade that brought riches to its citizens.  Its spies were placed in key positions across the world, gathering intelligence and ready to act.</Text>

			<Text>Dalmace arose out of necessity.  The turmoil of old kingdoms collapsing and new empires emerging left many people of the lower and middle classes marginalized.  Some stayed in their homelands but many fled as refugees, not knowing where to go.  They gathered in the country estates of nobles that did not have the heart or the force to deny their presence.  Soon leaders arose from the ranks of the refugees, calling for organization, protection, food, and resources.  Some nobles saw opportunity and joined their ranks, sharing their wealth.  Others refused, and their estates were ransacked.  These were the first Dalmace compounds, which would grow into cities that rivaled those of any other empire.  Dalmace is founded on ideals, and its strength comes from the tight camaraderie and evolving culture of its humble citizens.</Text>

			<Text>The Eruch Empire began as a series of impassioned debates between long established noble families about the growing chaos in the world and what could be done to stop it.  The debates soon reached a critical mass for action, fueled by the nobles' fear of an uncertain future as well as their desire to protect their wealth.  A secret council was formed, drawing on the leadership and military prowess that had been their inheritance from previous generations.  It mobilized a small but well-equipped army.  With it, the nobles carved out a large territory that would become the core of Eruch, and seceded from the old kingdoms.  Outwardly, leaders of Eruch profess the glories of civilized life, and seek to spread their ways to the ends of the earth.  They act as gentlemen in diplomatic affairs, but always have a rigid structure of military might ready to respond at their first call.</Text>

			<Text>The steady advance of science brought great changes to the processes by which products were manufactured, transported, and sold.  Many otherwise shrewd businessmen could not contend with the changes and faded away, leaving room for the more adaptable.  Orlin had no political existence when it began, and no desire for empire.  It was a collection of ambitious industrialists that banded together for mutual benefit.  They parcelled out markets like territories, and together came to dominate industries throughout the old kingdoms.  When the kingdoms began to fade, the Orlin tycoons clashed in a contest for power.  They encroached on each other's ventures, and delved into blackmail and assassination.  A tight oligarchy emerged which controlled nearly all the means of production.  With their industrial capacity, and the riches it brought, they formally entered the world stage as an empire.</Text>

They found allies in many of the old monarchists, who were looking for a way to preserve their influence, and together they became Vedria.  Their ranks mixed quickly, and before long every prominent leader was expected to be familiar with scientific processes, if not involved in research personally.  Vedria is marked by optimism for the future to come, and its citizens believe that the noble pursuit of science is the clear path towards it.  Scientists are consulted on matters of state, and given generous funding for their research.</Text>

Not a century ago, quelling the forces of a distant enemy required extensive fortifications, supply routes, and resources.  Horses had to be fed and quartered, and the loss of a supply line could mean the end of an otherwise honorable campaign.  Soldiers had to learn how to stare their enemy in the eye as they calmly readied their weapons and took life.  In our present age, soldiers can face each other in honorable combat while avoiding the savageries of the previous century.  The recent development of the Landship has made foot soldiers and cavalry all but obsolete.  Limited only by the resources needed to build it, the Landship can traverse a nation in a matter of days without need of rest.  Distant territories, once costly to conquer, are now within reach.  And with its cannons and near impenetrable armor, the Landship can easily make pliant all but the most savagely persistent of the uncivilized nations."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] - Cyrus Rotheram, address to the Eruch Senate</Text>

The swath of achievements in the past decades has only made more clear what has been the black mark on human history: the powerful few exploit the powerless many.  We have dismissed their difficulties as petty squabble, and appealed to our gentlemanly demeanor and productive enterprises as justification for our power, but the reality is that conditions are improving for us while they get worse for the common man.  Left unchecked, this gap will continue to grow until the common man is no more than a serf.  If I cannot appeal to you and the League on moral grounds - as it so seems, for I have tried tirelessly - let me warn you that our great society is becoming more and more unstable.  The common man may not be as educated or refined as we, but he has eyes and ears and a mind, and he will not be able to ignore the decadence of our lifestyle.  He will compare it to his own, and he will conspire with his neighbor.  Together they will grow and form a disgruntled block, and before the century is out we will have an uncontrollable rebellion on our hands.  And no amount of difference engine calculations or airship bombardments will be able to stop it, because those are built on the labor of those who have turned against us."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] - Clinton Alderdice, letter to the Grand Secretary of the League of Empires</Text>

As their mining operations expanded, the flakes and chunks of it were gathered into large parcels for shipment, and something very strange happened.  The parcels began to levitate off the ground.  Scientists began to analyze this material's unusual properties.  When masses of it are gathered together, it has the power to counteract gravity.  With careful engineering, these counter-gravitational forces can be guided into a reliable source of lift, allowing ships to float in the sky.  Its importance in the affairs of empire continues to grow, yet even today its properties are not well understood.  One careless inventor's apparatus electrified a small chunk of aetherium, causing it to shoot upwards and punch a hole through the roof.

Whereas most fuel sources yield their energy when burned, luboric is unfazed by flame, its green glow the only apparent reaction.  To unlock the enormous potential present within chunks of luboric ore, it must be submerged in a solution of enzymes and subjected to both heat and pressure.

			<Text>Architecture can be considered both an art and a science. Encompassing everything from the initial planning and design of a structure, to the actual construction process, architecture has been a crucial element of the building process since ancient times. One of the earliest known discussions of architecture and its principles, "De Architectura," was written by the Roman architect Vitruvius in the first century BC. A ten volume set comprising all of the most intricate details of Roman construction methods, Vitruvius's work is widely recognized today as a crucial development in the evolution of the architectural design process.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_TECH_COMBINED_ARMS_DESC">
			<Text>Combined arms is a military doctrine first adopted more than a thousand years ago, which involves the combination of different-but complimentary-unit types in an effort to improve the overall efficiency of the force as a whole. In ancient times, the combined arms tactic was utilized by many of the major powers, particularly the Greeks and Romans, who carefully coordinated light and heavy infantry, cavalry, and ranged weapons to create cohesive formations that played off each others' strengths and weaknesses. In the present day, the rise of aircraft-based weaponry has led to even more complex variations on the traditional concept of combined arms. Drone aircraft, satellite-guided missiles, and high-altitude bombers are just a few examples of the expanding toolset available to modern military commanders.</Text>

Drama is most commonly associated with theatrical performances - plays, musicals, and operas - although in modern times these traditional forms have been surpassed by television and movie productions. Poetry focuses on the use of written language to express both a literal meaning, and often a thought-provoking underlying message.</Text>

			<Text>The Renaissance Age of Exploration was initiated by the Portuguese under the leadership of Henry the Navigator. Relying on the Caravel, the Portuguese pushed south down the west coast of Africa, eventually rounding the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Ocean. By Christopher Columbus' voyage of 1492, the focus had changed to finding a western route to the riches of China and the Indies. Spain would take the lead for the next half century, achieving the first circumnavigation of the globe (in a voyage led -- but not survived -- by Ferdinand Magellan) and the conquest of many of the native civilizations of the Americas.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_TECH_GUILDS_DESC">
			<Text>In pre-industrial cities, craftsmen tended to form associations - or trade guilds - based upon their profession; these guilds were intended to both protect craft secrets as well as promote the influence and income of the craftsmen. Predecessors of the trade guilds were found as early as the 3rd Century BC in Rome and Han China. By 300 AD, the practice of craftsmen banding together had spread into Gupta India and Ptolemaic Egypt. In the Middle Ages, guild organizations spread rapidly from Italy throughout Europe; 12th Century records in Paris and London each list over 100 guilds chartered by the cities. In some cases, so powerful were some guilds that they became the governing body of cities, indicated by the guildhalls found in Germany, Switzerland and Holland.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over time, the guilds took on the task of safeguarding quality and of instruction in the craft, with a life-long progression from apprentice to grandmaster. To insure product quality, the system of trademarks indicating that the item had passed both guild and government standards evolved. However, over time the influence and power of the guilds declined as they fragmented with the coming of new trades, government concerns, and mass production methods. In France, for instance, the guilds were abolished in 1791 AD by the Le Chapelier Law; other countries followed soon did the same. Although largely supplanted by unions in the Industrial Age, there are still examples of guilds in existence, notably in the realms of film, literature and other artistic professions.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_TECH_INDUSTRIALIZATION_DESC">
			<Text>Industrialization is viewed as the transition from an agrarian society into an industrial one, which is typically accompanied by widespread social and economic change throughout the community. The Industrial Revolution, beginning in Europe during the 18th century, brought about immense changes in the way people lived their daily lives. With increasingly complex machinery and tools available, many trades that were once left to talented craftsmen became obsolete with the advent of assembly lines operated by droves of unskilled factory laborers.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_TECH_INTERNET_DESC">
			<Text>The ancestry of the Internet lies in the development of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, for use by its university contractors and research labs in the exchange of information. It soon became a critical piece of the infrastructure for the scientific research community in the United States; tools and applications - such as simple mail transfer protocol (commonly referred to as e-mail) and file transfer protocol (FTP) for longer transmission - were developed in short order.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the early 1980s, the Defense Department adopted the privately-developed transmission control protocol (TCP), which enabled different makes of computers on networks to route and reassemble data packets anywhere in the world. Along with the internet protocol (IP), a global address system, the TCP "open architecture" approach was enthusiastically accepted by most researchers and businesses around the world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Within a few years, the network was transferring millions of bits per second, and several commercial networks were flourishing. In 1993 the University of Illinois made freely available "Mosaic," a new type of program for a new Internet technology dubbed the "World Wide Web." Within a few months, a number of corporations such as Netscape and Microsoft had entered the exploding field with browser and server software for use on personal computers. By the late 1990s there were approximately 100,000 Internet service providers around the world. In the first decades of the new century, the Internet was expanding an estimated 100% annually, making it the greatest conduit for information and entertainment in world history.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_TECH_TELECOM_DESC">
			<Text>Telecommunication allows for the transmission of data and information over long distances using various types of signaling devices. Early forms of primitive ranged communication, including the use of smoke and signal flags, eventually gave way to telegraphs, and later, the telephone. Scientific research and engineering, particularly in the last 30 years, has led to breakthroughs in our ability to communicate globally. Orbiting satellites now provide a means for the transmission of data even to the most remote areas on Earth. Television, internet, cellular telephones, and GPS are now fully integrated into the daily lives of millions across the world because of telecommunications research.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_FLYER_STRATEGY">
			<Text>Flyers have a short range and a moderate attack.  They excel at hit and run tactics, especially against Airships and Sky Fortresses, which are too bulky to effectively dodge their strikes.  Their limited range restricts them to mostly defensive roles at first, but later on the Sky Fortress can act as their mobile base, transporting them directly into the battlefield.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_FLYER_TEXT">
			<Text>The Flyer began as an inventor's novelty, one of the many results of the widespread participation in science brought on by the Age of Steam.  Advancements in propulsion had done wonders for land and sea vehicles; why not apply them in the pursuit of the eternal dream of human flight?  The engine mounted on the fuselage was bulky, so every ounce of weight had to be saved if the plane was to fly.  Cloth was used instead of metal wherever possible.  Later, as technology advanced, weapons were mounted on it and liberties were taken with the original design.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_LANDSHIP_STRATEGY">
			<Text>The Landship is heavily armored and excels at ground combat.  Use it to defeat other land units and wear down cities for capture.  Its armor will help protect it against the smaller guns of Flyers, but it is vulnerable to cannon fire from Airships.  Escort the Landship with units that are strong against air units, such as Flyers and Anti-Air Guns, for maximum survivability.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_LANDSHIP_TEXT">
			<Text>The Landship was everything the land ironclad was to be but was not.  The discovery of luboric increased the energy available to power such a vehicle exponentially, allowing for more armor and weaponry while maintaining the same maneuverability.  It became the gold standard on the battlefield, capable of destroying nearly any other land unit.  With several of them, a commander could quickly take out an army or encircle a city.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_LAND_IRONCLAD_STRATEGY">
			<Text>The most basic type of landship unit, the Land Ironclad is well armored and shines in ground combat.  Use it to easily defeat primitive land units and wear down cities for capture.

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_LAND_IRONCLAD_TEXT">
			<Text>Much had been learned from the construction of the "Iron Horse" that was the railroad.  Soon, inventors tried to engineer a vehicle with the power of a locomotive without need of a track.  Designing the apparatus for moving the unwieldy metal beasts that were the first prototypes proved extremely difficult.  The process merged into a simpler design with much less armor plating, but enough to withstand gunfire and the elements.  The first drivers found that having a light, maneuverable craft was much more effective than a bulky one.  It allowed for quick travel on less fuel, as well as agility in combat.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_LAND_LEVIATHAN_STRATEGY">
			<Text>The Land Leviathan is the pinnacle of landship units, bringing devastation to any other land unit.  Use it to destroy vulnerable enemy Anti-Air Guns and ensure your air units stay safe.  Its armor will help protect it against the smaller guns of Flyers, but it is still vulnerable to cannon fire from Airships and Sky Fortresses.  It is best to protect the expensive Land Leviathan with units that are strong against air units, such as Flyers and Anti-Air Guns.</Text>

During training they learn to move and think as one unit, developing a shorthand language for giving complex commands quickly.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_LONGSWORDSMAN_STRATEGY">
			<Text>The Longswordsman is the standard medieval infantry combat unit. It is more powerful than the Knight, but much slower. It also outclasses the Pikeman, but doesn't receive that unit's bonus versus mounted units. Use Longswordsmen and Catapults to attack enemy cities.</Text>

			<Text>The Machine Gun is the penultimate non-siege ranged unit. It is more powerful than earlier ranged units.

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_MODERN_ARMOR_STRATEGY">

			<Text>The Nuclear Submarine is tougher and stronger than the earlier model. It too is invisible to most units and can see other submarines. Most importantly, Nuclear Submarines can carry guided missiles and nuclear missiles. Like submarines, Nuclear Subs are vulnerable to enemy Destroyers, Missile Cruisers, and Subs, so send units of your own out ahead to make sure the coast is clear.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_PARATROOPER_STRATEGY">
			<Text>The Paratrooper is a late-game infantryman. It is somewhat weaker than a mechanized infantry unit; however, it can parachute up to 9 tiles away (when starting in friendly territory). This allows the paratrooper to literally jump over enemy positions and destroy road networks, pillage vital resources and so forth, wrecking havoc behind his lines. The Paratrooper is at great risk when on such missions, so make sure the target is worth it!</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_POLISH_WINGED_HUSSAR_STRATEGY">
			<Text>The Winged Hussar is the Lancer replacement, and only the Polish may build it. Faster and more powerful than the Lancer, the Winged Hussar forces a defender to retreat when it inflicts more damage than it receives. A defender who cannot retreat instead takes extra damage.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_PORTUGUESE_NAU_STRATEGY">
			<Text>This melee naval unit replaces the Caravel and is skilled at exploration. When it is in a tile next to land owned by another Civilization or City-State you are at peace with, it may perform a one-time trade mission to earn [ICON_GOLD] Gold and XP. The further the land is from your own capital, the greater the bonus, so it is best to use on distant players. Use this unit to explore the map and uncover the locations of other players.</Text>
		</Row>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_SKY_FORTRESS_STRATEGY">
			<Text>The Sky Fortress is the most advanced type of airship unit, and houses significant firepower.  Not only can it use its cannons to attack land targets and other airships, but also it can act as a mobile base for a Flyer.  With a Flyer running strikes on nearby airship units, the Sky Fortress poses a serious threat to many types of units, but is still vulnerable to enemy Flyers and Anti-Air Guns.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_SKY_FORTRESS_TEXT">
			<Text>The majestic Sky Fortress is quite a sight to behold.  Much larger than the airship, it casts a wide shadow on the ground below that strikes fear into the hearts of foes.  It is outfitted with heavy weaponry, but kept aloft through advanced applications of aetherium's lift properties.  Inside the ship's body are a variety of accommodations: war rooms used by generals above the battlefield, a small hangar which can host a squadron of Flyers, and even parlors for recreation.  The Sky Fortress became the centerpiece of airship fleets, a mobile command center that could rain death on the land below and blow enemy airships out of the sky.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_SONGHAI_MUSLIMCAVALRY_STRATEGY">
			<Text>This is a Songhai unique unit, replacing the Knight. This unit has the same statistics as the Knight, but it is significantly better at attacking cities.

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_VIKING_SCENARIO_CITYSTATE_CONNACHT_DESC">
			<Text>Great tomb complexes in the northwest of Ireland speak to the presence of people there since the glaciers retreated at the end of the last ice age. Irish legends tell that when the Tuatha De Dannan invaded the land and fought the Fir Bolg, they were so impressed by the Fir Bolg that they gave them a quarter of the island - the area that would become the kingdom of Connacht.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unambiguous reference to the area begins around the 6th Century AD in the Annals of Ulster, marking the death of prominent lords of that realm. The Vikings arrived at Connacht at the start of the 9th Century, and around this time the ruling house of Connacht was founded by Conchobar mac Taidg Mor, and the O Conchobair ruled Connacht until the middle of the 15th Century. The rulers of Connacht were often at war with the other Irish kingdoms, as well as the British and the Vikings who were settling Ireland.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Connacht, there are two mysterious megaliths - the Turoe Stone and the Castlestrange Stone, which are covered in carvings of a style and date commonly associated with mainland Europe during the Iron Age. The stones were likely brought to Ireland and moved over time, away from the successive waves of invaders who came to the land.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_VIKING_SCENARIO_CITYSTATE_GALLOWAY_DESC">
			<Text>At the tip of Southwestern Scotland is the Gall-Ghaidhealaibh - the land of the foreign Gaels. Isolated by its rugged coastline and hilly northern border, it was nonetheless drawn on Ptolemy's map of Britain. The Romans called the inhabitants the Novantae, and the missionary Saint Ninian built a church here, but much of its history is shrouded in legend. The Welsh poets believed that one of King Arthur's Three Thrones of Britain was in Galloway, called Pen Rhionydd.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At some point in the late 7th century, Galloway was wrestled from control of the Britons by the Kingdom of Bernicia, who displaced the locals from the flat arable land and forced them into the hills. But the remoteness of the region meant it was easy prey for the Vikings and the Irish (especially the Irish Vikings) for whom the territory was just a short hop across the Irish Sea.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Norse Gaels, the Gall-Gaedhil, are the best-known inhabitants of Galloway. The Norse controlled the Irish Sea, and their settlements dotted its edges. Despite their Gaelic that they shared with the nascent Scots, they were indisputably their own people, sailing from their isolated lands to wreak havoc on the coastlines of Britain. This isolation meant that the Lords of Galloway were effectively kings on their own until late in the Middle Ages, starting with Suibne mac Cineda in the early 10th century and extending until the 12th. Though nominally under the High King of Scotland, they could ignore or pay tribute to him as their power allowed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Law of Galloway lasted another two centuries after their Lords lost power, a tribute to the splendid isolation of the land and people of Galloway.</Text>

			<Text>The Romans called the lands of the Ordovices, Gangani, and Deceangli "Venedotia," but the mountainous land on the Irish Sea was not a land under their control. As Roman power faded in Britain, the Kingdom of Gwynedd emerged, founded by the legendary Cunedda of Lothia. The land's name has been interpreted as meaning "Land of the War-Host," though the exact meaning is lost to time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gwynedd quickly became preeminent among the petty kingdoms of Wales. Maelgwyn the Tall in particular became the subject of many myths and legends, and was described by Gildas as one of the five greatest British Kings. Gildas also gave Maelgwyn a curious appellative - "Dragon of the Island" which may have morphed over time to "Pendragon" of literary fame. But Maelgwyn's death in 547 left a vacuum, and a series of succession wars followed. Gwynedd did ally with Powys to fight the Anglians in the early 6th century, and Cadwallon ap Cadfan launched a furious assault on the Northumbrians, sacking York in 633 and laying waste to the land.  He and his son Cadwaladr Fendigad became the last two High Kings of Britain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The house of Cunedda died off in the early 8th Century, and the house of Aberffraw (distantly related by ancestry) had to deal with incursions by the Vikings and Irish, ruling their subsidiary kingdom of Powys, and fighting with the other high Welsh families until they were overthrown by Howell the Good, who took the opportunity to straighten up the place and modernize it like those really progressive kingdoms in Wessex that had things like codified laws and their own money.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By the Norman Invasion, Gwynedd had returned to fractious infighting amongst its nobles, and William the Conquer let his barons subjugate Wales as they could. But Norman authority held only tenuously in Gwynedd's high mountain lands and in the hearts of its people, who still remembered when they had been kings.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_VIKING_SCENARIO_CITYSTATE_MEATH_DESC">
			<Text>For 1000 years, Mide, or Meath, was the central Kingdom of Ireland, both geographically and spiritually. Tradition dates the founding of Meath to the First Century AD, by Tuathal Techtmar, ancestor of the great Niall of the Nine Hostages.  Tuathal carved himself a kingdom from territory seized from Ulster, Leinster, Connacht, and Munster and named the resulting territory Meath. The Ui Neill kings of the South were the traditional rulers of Meath.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Meath's importance to the High Kings of Ireland was further enhanced because the Hill of Tara was situated there. The Hill of Tara is a complex of barrows and earthworks dating back to the Iron Age, and traditionally the place where the High King was crowned. The Hill of Tara has been used as a ritual location since the Neolithic, and was the spiritual heart of Ireland until the 12th Century, though its importance declined with the ascension of the British and the expansion of Christianity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whether or not the Irish High Kings sat in court on the Hill of Tara or not, Meath's central location in Ireland and its proximity to the Norse Irish settlements made it a kingdom of great importance. The Battle of Clontarf was fought on its soil, where the last great High King of Ireland, Brian Boru, fell.</Text>

			<Text>Munster, in the southwest of Ireland, is one of the five great kingdoms of Ireland. In the second century, Ptolemy records the land as belonging to the Iverni tribe. According to legend, Bodb Derg was the second King of the Tuatha De Danann and the first of the Kings of Munster. The Eoganachta dynasty ruled from  the 7th century,  after the conquests of Failbe Flann mac Aedo Duib. The Eoganachta would in time become one of Ireland's most important clans, though they never became High Kings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Vikings invaded starting in the 8th Century, and would in time found the cities of Cork, Waterford, and Limerick.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The last great High King of Ireland, Brian Boru, first proclaimed himself King of Munster before he was able to wrestle control of the kingship from the Ui Neill. His descendants, the O'Brians, were hereditary rulers of Munster as well, until the dissolution of the kingdom in the early 12th Century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By 1118, Munster had fractured into three smaller kingdoms: Thomond, Desmond, and Omond.</Text>

			<Text>The adjoining kingdoms of Deira and Bernecia were united by force when King Aethelfrith of Bernicia conquered Deira in 604. But this victory was short-lived, and when Aethelfrith was killed in 616, the son of the former king of Deira, Edwin, was made king of the combined lands. But it was not until the rule of King Oswald in 634 that Northumbria was finally consolidated into a single Anglian kingdom. Oswald quickly expanded his kingdom and Christianized it with the help of Saint Aidan of Iona.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Northumbria was often at war with Mercia. Oswald was killed in battle with the Mercians in 650, and the Picts rose up and defeated the Northumbrians in 685. A brief period of stability under the reign of Aldfrith followed, but Northumbria had lost its prestige and power, and was conquered by the Danish brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and the colorfully-named Ivar the Boneless.  A brief uprising by Aella of Northumberland was brutally suppressed. Now subject to the Danelaw, a series of puppet kings ruled Northumberland until Erik Bloodaxe in 954. From then on, Northumberland was no kingdom, but a mere Earldom.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]William the Conquerer quickly set his eyes on Northumbria, recognizing it as a valuable buffer against the North, and as a symbol to resistance to his rule. He attempted to install one of his barons as an overlord, but the baron and 700 of his retainers were slaughtered in the city of Durham. This led William to conduct a punitive campaign into Northumbria, partitioning it into an Earldom seated in Durham, and the region of Northumberland. The Normans built the city of Newcastle to secure their hold on this new territory of theirs, but the hold was tentative. The lands of Northumbria were long afterwards a fractious border country, rebelling against rule from the south and fighting the protracted border war with the Scots to the North.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_VIKING_SCENARIO_CITYSTATE_POWYS_DESC">
			<Text>The Roman Empire marked out a territory in Britain between the Cambrian Mountains and Western Midlands, and built a capital at the site of modern Wroxeter called Viroconium Cornoviorum. As Roman power in Britain faded in the Dark Ages, a new state arose in the traditional lands of the Ordovices and Cornoviis, extending from the Cambrian Mountains to the Western Midlands. By the middle of the 5th Century AD, Powys was solidly established as a kingdom of Britain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first and greatest ruling house of Powys was the Gwerthrynion, who claimed the legendary Vortigern as their founder. The historical warlord Vortigern would later become the model for the literary King Arthur, and the literary embellishment of Arthur has done something to mythologize the kingdom of Powys as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Early in the 6th Century, Powys was ravaged by the Northumbrians and portions annexed by their erstwhile allies the Mercians, but Powys stormed back, conquering territory from the English until by mutual agreement a border was established at Offa's Dyke in the middle of the 7th Century. Offa's Dyke remains today the border between Wales and England.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Powys was eventually subsumed by the Kingdom of Gwynedd on the death of the last Gwerthyrnion king in 855. When Howell the Good became king of Gwynedd in 942, he already ruled most of the lands that make up modern Wales. Through savvy politicking and legal reforms, he made his kingdoms into great powers on the island, codifying Welsh Law and creating the first indigenous Welsh coin since the Bronze Age. On Howell's death, Powys was given to one of his sons, but the greater Welsh kingdom was reassembled by his grandson Maredudd ab Owain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over time, the power of the great Welsh families waned, and invaders from Ireland and the Vikings chipped away at the throne of Powys, as usurpers seized the throne and were overthrown by pretenders of the old houses. By the time of the Norman Invasion, constant fractious warfare wracked the land, and William the Conquerer was content to leave Wales to his barons to deal with. They in turn made a complete hash of it.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_VIKING_SCENARIO_CITYSTATE_SCOTLAND_DESC">
			<Text>There have been people living in the north of Britain since the end of the last ice age, about 8,500 years before the Romans recorded works on the island. Neolithic ruins in Scotland predate the famous Skara Brae of the Orkneys, and archeological evidence reveals evidence of warring communities living in fortified villages through the Iron Age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Caledonians fought hard and often successfully against the Romans in Britain, forcing them to retreat from their tentative forts and outposts behind Hadrian's Wall. The land was occupied by the Picts and Britons thereafter, until the Dark Ages, when the Irish, Anglo-Saxons, and then Vikings invaded and created permanent settlements in Scotland. Saint Ninian's mission brought Christianity to the region around 450 AD, although apparently the Picts then renounced it until Saint Columba arrived in 563.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Legend has it that the Picts were betrayed by the Scots king Kenneth Mac Alpin, who invited the Pictish king Drest and his nobles to a feast, plied them with drink, and then pulled the pins from their benches, sending them into spikey pits concealed beneath.  The truth is somewhat less fanciful - Mac Alpin had claim to the crown of both kingdoms, and managed to combine them into what would become the Kingdom of Alba.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Kingdom of Alba became the core of what is recognized as Scotland. Through conquest and expansion, the kingdom of Strathclyde was added, and the southern barrier pushed to the River Tweed - the modern-day Southeastern border of Scotland.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]King Duncan led an expedition to try to seize the lands of his rival Macbeth around 1039. The expedition was a terminal disaster for Duncan, who was killed in battle, and Macbeth then became the king of the Scots. It should be noted that the conflict between Macbeth and Duncan was the basis for Shakespeare's play, and is historically accurate if you ignore such simple details as the age of both Duncan and Macbeth, the stated relationship between the two men, and the entire chronology given in  the play. Duncan's son Malcolm did follow Macbeth as king of Scotland, so at least he got that part right. And as King James was Shakespeare's patron, a colorful reinterpretation of history that flattered the man paying the bills is perhaps understandable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When William the Conquerer invaded Britain, Edgar the Aethling sought refuge in Scotland with an eye to claiming his kingship to the south, but by 1072 William had successfully invaded Scotland and forced Malcolm (who had become king in 1057) to pay him tribute and hostages.</Text>
